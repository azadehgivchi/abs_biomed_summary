One of the most important elements associated with increase in oncological outcome in children is fertility preservation for future. It is obvious that chemo and radio therapy used in cancer treatment aim to destroy tumor cells, but they also impact healthy tissues. The nega-tive influence of these types of therapy can be observed in every patient's organ. One of the most serious complication of oncological treatment is reproductive impairment. This determinates directly mental and social state of the patient as well as quality of life after the treatment, particularly in adolescent. Commonly used methods of fertility preservation in female children are: freezing ovarian tissue or unfertilized oocytes. Among male children freezing of testicular tissue or ejaculated sperm are conducted. Described methods of fertility preservation among children and adolescents are on the experimental stage and none of them provide 100% effectiveness.
