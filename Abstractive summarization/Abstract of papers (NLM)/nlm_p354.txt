Behavioral health emergencies most commonly present as depression, suicidal 
behavior, aggression, and severe disorganization. Emergency clinicians should 
avoid relying solely on past medical history or previous psychiatric diagnoses 
that might prematurely rule out medical pathologies. Treatments for behavioral 
health emergencies consist of de-escalation interventions aimed at preventing 
agitation, aggression, and harm. This issue reviews medical pathologies and 
underlying causes that can result in psychiatric presentations and summarizes 
evidence-based practices to evaluate, manage, and refer patients with behavioral 
health emergencies.
