Communication disorders can arise as a consequence of right hemispheric brain 
injury due to, for example, stroke. These disorders can comprise language 
comprehension, language production and pragmatic language use. If these problems 
are not recognised in time, treatment will probably focus on behavioural 
problems, which would lead to further deterioration of the patient due to an 
escalation in interaction. We present a patient in whom this situation occured. 
However, by addressing her underlying communication problem, we were able to 
improve her quality of life.
