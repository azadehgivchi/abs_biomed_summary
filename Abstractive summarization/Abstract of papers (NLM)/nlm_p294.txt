MicroRNAs are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by 
means of partial complementarity to microRNA binding sites at their target 
genes. These molecules have emerged as key regulators of almost every biological 
process including accurate control of neuronal gene expression. The authors 
discuss the current state of microRNA research, including studies of psychiatric 
disorders (schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and affective disorders). 
Stress has also been shown to have a critical role in the development of 
psychiatric disorders, at least partially, through mechanisms related to neural 
plasticity. Synaptic connections in the brain undergo experience-dependent 
functional or morphological changes through complex pathways that are not yet 
fully understood, but for which microRNAs might have a critical role. The focus 
is on the role that microRNAs play in the development of psychiatric disorders 
and their potential to serve as biomarkers of disease as well as targets for 
pharmacological treatment.
