Care of people with serious mental illness in prayer camps in 
low-income countries generates human rights concerns and ethical challenges for 
outcome researchers. Aims To ethically evaluate joining traditional faith 
healing with psychiatric care including medications (Clinical trials.gov 
identifier NCT02593734).
Residents of a Ghana prayer camp were randomly assigned to receive 
either indicated medication for schizophrenia or mood disorders along with usual 
prayer camp activities (prayers, chain restraints and fasting) (n = 71); or the 
prayer camp activities alone (n = 68). Masked psychologists assessed Brief 
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) outcomes at 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Researchers 
discouraged use of chaining, but chaining decisions remained under the control 
of prayer camp staff.
RESULTS: Total BPRS symptoms were significantly lower in the experimental group 
(P = 0.003, effect size -0.48). There was no significant difference in days in 
chains.
CONCLUSIONS: Joining psychiatric and prayer camp care brought symptom benefits 
but, in the short-run, did not significantly reduce days spent in chains. 
Declaration of interest None.
