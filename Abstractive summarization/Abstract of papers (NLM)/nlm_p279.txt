Adolescents and young adults are at particularly at-risk population in mental 
health. For a large majority of patients suffering from chronic psychiatric 
condition, the age of onset of psychiatric symptoms is less than 24 years, while 
the coverage in psychiatric care is the lowest between 16 and 24. Presenting a 
psychiatric pathology during childhood and adolescence constitutes an 
independent risk factor for the occurrence of adverse life events in adulthood. 
Furthermore, that population is at the edge between child and adolescent mental 
health services (CAMHS) and adult mental health services (AMHS). Transition is 
the deliberate and planned movement from CAMHS to AMHS. CAMHS and AMHS struggle 
to achieve optimal transitions between them. Many barriers exist at the 
interface of the two types of structure and some young people who require 
continuous care during this period do not have access to it. There are also too 
few specific psychiatric services for the population of adolescents and young 
adults. Some recommendations emerge to intend to guide practices, but the 
literature lacks data to better define this population and build guidelines 
about the transition between CAMHS and AMHS and about specific services for 
adolescents and young adults in psychiatry.
