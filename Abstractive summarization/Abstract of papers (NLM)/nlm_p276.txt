The use of behavior modifying drugs may be considered in birds with behavior 
problems, especially those refractory to behavior modification therapy and 
environmental management. To accomplish behavior change, a variety of drugs can 
be used, including psychoactive drugs, hormones, antihistamines, analgesics, and 
anticonvulsants. Because their prescription to birds is off-label, these drugs 
are considered appropriate only when a sound rationale can be provided for their 
use. This requires a (correct) behavioral diagnosis to be established. In 
addition, regular monitoring and follow-up are warranted to determine the 
efficacy of the treatment and evaluate the occurrence of potential adverse side 
effects.
