Dyslexia is difficulty in acquiring reading skills despite adequate intelligence 
and sufficient reading opportunities. Its origin is still under debate. Studies 
usually focus on a singular cause for dyslexia; however, some researchers argue 
that dyslexia reflects multiple deficits. Two of the abilities under 
investigation in dyslexia are working memory (WM) and auditory temporal 
processing (ATP). In order to better evaluate the relative roles of WM and ATP 
in dyslexia, in the present study, we tested the contribution of WM and ATP to 
different types of reading performance and phonological awareness in dyslexia, 
using a multidimensional approach. Seventy-eight adults with dyslexia and 23 
normal-reading adults performed WM and ATP tasks, as well as reading and 
phonological awareness tests. Readers with dyslexia showed poorer performance on 
all tests. Both WM and ATP were significant predictors of reading performance 
and phonological awareness among participants with dyslexia. Dividing 
participants with dyslexia according to their performance level on WM and ATP 
tasks revealed group differences in reading and phonological awareness tests. 
Both WM and ATP contribute to dyslexia, and varying levels of difficulties in 
both of these abilities are observed among this population. This is strong 
evidence in favor of the multi-deficit approach in dyslexia, and suggests that 
researchers should consider this approach in future studies of dyslexia.
