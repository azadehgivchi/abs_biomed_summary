There is an emerging consensus that genomic researchers should, at a minimum, 
offer to return to individual participants clinically valid, medically important 
and medically actionable genomic findings (for example, pathogenic variants in 
BRCA1) identified in the course of research. However, this is not a common 
practice in psychiatric genetics research. Furthermore, psychiatry researchers 
often generate findings that do not meet all of these criteria, yet there may be 
ethically compelling arguments to offer selected results. Here, we review the 
return of results debate in genomics research and propose that, as for genomic 
studies of other medical conditions, psychiatric genomics researchers should 
offer findings that meet the minimum criteria stated above. Additionally, if 
resources allow, psychiatry researchers could consider offering to return 
pre-specified 'clinically valuable' findings even if not medically 
actionable-for instance, findings that help corroborate a psychiatric diagnosis, 
and findings that indicate important health risks. Similarly, we propose 
offering 'likely clinically valuable' findings, specifically, variants of 
uncertain significance potentially related to a participant's symptoms. The goal 
of this Perspective is to initiate a discussion that can help identify optimal 
ways of managing the return of results from psychiatric genomics research.
