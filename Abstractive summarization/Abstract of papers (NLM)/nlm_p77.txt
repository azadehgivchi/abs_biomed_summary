To examine whether early rise of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) after patient hospitalization correlates with 30-day mortality in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
This retrospective study included all patients receiving treatment for spontaneous ICH between January 2015 and September 2016 at the Jiading District Central Hospital Affiliated Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences in Shanghai, China. NLR was determined at admission (T1), at 24-48 hours (T2) and 5-7 days (T3). NLR and clinicopathologic features were compared between those who survived for >30 days vs not. Multivariate regression was used to identify risk factors for 30-day mortality.
A total of 275 subjects were included in the analysis: 235 survived for at least 30 days; the remaining 40 subjects died within 30 days. The patients who died within 30 days had higher ICH score, larger ICH volume, and lower GCS score (all P < 0.05). In comparison with the baseline (NLRT 1 ), NLR at 24-48 hours (NLRT 2 ) and 5-7 days (NLRT 3 ) was significantly higher in patients who died within 30 days (P < 0.05), but not in patients surviving for >30 days. In the multivariate analysis, the 30-day mortality was associated with both NLRT 2 (OR 1.112, 95%CI 1.032-1.199, P = 0.006) and NLRT 3 (OR 1.163, 95%CI 1.067-1.268, P = 0.001). Spearman correlation analysis showed that both NLRT 2 and NLRT 3 correlated inversely with GCS score and positively with ICH score and ICH volume at the baseline.
Early rise of NLR predicts 30-day mortality in patients with spontaneous ICH.
