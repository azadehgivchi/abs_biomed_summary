Admissions to PICU places pediatric patients at increased risk of 
persistent psychological and psychiatric morbidity. This systematic review aimed 
to summarize and critically examine literature regarding psychological and 
psychiatric outcomes of pediatric patients following PICU admission.
MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, 
PsycInfo, CINAHL, LILACS, and SciELO were searched up to May 2016.
Cohort studies about psychological and psychiatric outcomes of 
pediatric patients following PICU admission; full-text records published in 
English, Spanish, or Portuguese in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2015 were 
included. Neonatal patient population (age, <1 mo), follow-up after PICU 
discharge (<3 mo), and nonprimary literature were excluded. Two reviewers 
independently screened studies based on the predetermined exclusion criteria.
Data were extracted using an adapted tool. The internal 
validity and risk of bias were assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The search yielded 1,825 studies after the removal of 
duplications, of which eight met the inclusion criteria. Methodologic quality of 
the studies ranged from low to high, with an average score of five of nine. Of 
all the studies, half had a control group. Regarding the length of follow-up, 
most of the studies ranged from 3 to 12 months.
Psychological and psychiatric outcomes after pediatric critical 
illness appear to be substantial issues that need to be further studied. Our 
review highlights the need for psychological screening of pediatric patients and 
their parents following PICU admission since these patients are a vulnerable 
population at risk for developing psychiatric responses.
