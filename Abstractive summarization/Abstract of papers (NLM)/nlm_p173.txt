22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) is associated with high rates 
of neurodevelopmental disorder, however, the links between developmental 
coordination disorder (DCD), intellectual function and psychiatric disorder 
remain unexplored. Aims To establish the prevalence of indicative DCD in 
children with 22q11.2DS and examine associations with IQ, neurocognition and 
psychopathology.
Neurocognitive assessments and psychiatric interviews of 70 children 
with 22q11.2DS (mean age 11.2, s.d. = 2.2) and 32 control siblings (mean age 
11.5, s.d. = 2.1) were carried out in their homes. Nine children with 22q11.2DS 
and indicative DCD were subsequently assessed in an occupational therapy clinic.
RESULTS: Indicative DCD was found in 57 (81.4%) children with 22q11.2DS compared 
with 2 (6.3%) control siblings (odds ratio (OR) = 36.7, P < 0.001). Eight of 
nine (89%) children with indicative DCD met DSM-5 criteria for DCD. Poorer 
coordination was associated with increased numbers of anxiety, (P < 0.001), 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (P < 0.001) and autism-spectrum 
disorder (ASD) symptoms (P < 0.001) in children with 22q11.2DS. Furthermore, 
100% of children with 22q11.2DS and ADHD had indicative DCD (20 of 20), as did 
90% of children with anxiety disorder (17 of 19) and 96% of children who 
screened positive for ASD (22 of 23). The Developmental Coordination Disorder 
Questionnaire score was related to sustained attention (P = 0.006), even after 
history of epileptic fits (P = 0.006) and heart problems (P = 0.009) was taken 
into account.
Clinicians should be aware of the high risk of coordination 
difficulties in children with 22q11.2DS and its association with risk of mental 
disorder and specific neurocognitive deficits. Declaration of interest None.
