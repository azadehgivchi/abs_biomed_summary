There is an increasing awareness that the current approach to 
clinical thought and work in psychiatry in relation to psychiatric diagnosis, 
treatment and research has its limitations. This necessitates a process to 
reform both the clinical practice and future scientific research. One way to 
reform this is the transdiagnostic approach.
To clarify the psychological, biological and therapeutic aspects of a 
transdiagnostic approach in psychiatry.
An analysis of new approaches based on recent findings from the recent 
literature.
Transdiagnostic psychiatry is a relatively new concept which is still 
under development. The examples extracted from the reviewed literature on 
developmental psychology, neurobiology and treatment demonstrate that this 
approach may lead to improvements in clinical care and generate new etiological 
insights.
CONCLUSION: A transdiagnostic approach in psychiatry may lead to new insights 
that are relevant for clinical practice and future scientific research.
