This study aimed to evaluate the medium-term effects that hospitalization in the 
first 48 months of life has on the development of psychiatric disorders at 6 and 
11 years of age among individuals in a birth cohort in a middle-income country. 
We analyzed data from a 2004 birth cohort (N = 4,231) in the city of Pelotas, 
Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. The frequency of hospitalization was 
investigated at 12, 24 and 48 months of life. When the children were 6 and 11 
years old, psychiatric disorders were investigated with the Development and 
Well-Being Assessment. We used logistic regression to adjust for potential 
confounders. The overall frequency of hospitalization during the first 48 months 
of life was 33.1% (95%CI: 31.4; 34.7). Among the hospitalized children 25.6% 
(95%CI: 24.1; 27.1), 4.7% (95%CI: 4.0; 5.5) and 2.8% (95%CI: 2.3; 3.5) were 
hospitalized 1, 2 or â‰¥ 3 times during this period, respectively. After 
adjustment for potential confounders, the chance of presenting any psychiatric 
disorder at 6 and 11 years of age was higher for the children who had been 
hospitalized during the first 48 months of life than for those who had not, with 
OR of 1.50 (95%CI: 1.19; 1.88) and 1.63 (95%CI: 1.28; 2.07), respectively. Our 
results support the hypothesis that hospitalization in the early stages of life 
has an effect on the subsequent mental health of children. Preventive measures 
are needed in order to minimize the negative experiences of children who are 
hospitalized during infancy.
