S-Adenosyl methionine (SAMe), as a major methyl donor, exerts its influence on 
central nervous system function through cellular transmethylation pathways, 
including the methylation of DNA, histones, protein phosphatase 2A, and several 
catecholamine moieties. Based on available evidence, this review focuses on the 
lifelong range of severe neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and 
their associated neuropathologies, which have been linked to the deficiency/load 
of SAMe production or/and the disturbance in transmethylation pathways. Also 
included in this review are the present-day applications of SAMe in the 
treatment in these diseases in each age group.
