The purpose of this study is to describe forensic psychiatric patients' 
experiences of and perspectives on forensic psychiatric treatment.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight forensic psychiatric patients were interviewed, and 
the resultant research material was analyzed by narrative analysis.
Patients' narratives contain different themes telling different things 
and the personnel need to pay attention to these.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The findings of the present study should direct the 
forensic psychiatric personnel's attention to the notion that forensic 
psychiatric patients' experiences of their treatment can improve the quality of 
patient-centered care and reduce bureaucracy.
