There has been increasing interest within psychiatry in the concept 
of multimorbidity because psychiatric patients typically present with multiple 
concurrent disorders, these disorders mutually exacerbate one another, and their 
interaction shapes treatment options. Metrics have not been developed to 
document multimorbidity in psychiatric clinical practice.
Four classes of indicators relevant to multimorbidity were defined and 
evaluated among veterans treated in mental health specialty clinics nationally 
in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in fiscal year 2012.
Of the 843,583 veterans with at least three visits to a specialty 
mental health clinic, 94.6% had more than one general medical or mental disorder 
and 77.6% had more than one mental disorder, compared with 30.6% with 
co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders.
Real-world psychiatric care is more accurately approached from the 
multimorbidity perspective than from the perspective of principal, dual, or 
comorbid diagnoses.
