Heme oxygenase (HO) family catalyzes the conversion of heme into free iron, 
carbon monoxide and biliverdin. It possesses two well-characterized isoforms: 
HO-1 and HO-2. Under brain physiological conditions, the expression of HO-2 is 
constitutive, abundant and ubiquitous, whereas HO-1 mRNA and protein are 
restricted to small populations of neurons and neuroglia. HO-1 is an inducible 
enzyme that has been shown to participate as an essential defensive mechanism 
for neurons exposed to oxidant challenges, being related to antioxidant defenses 
in certain neuropathological conditions. Considering that neurodegenerative 
diseases (Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple 
Sclerosis (MS)) and neuropsychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, Bipolar 
Disorder (BD) and schizophrenia) are associated with increased inflammatory 
markers, impaired redox homeostasis and oxidative stress, conditions that may be 
associated with alterations in HO-levels/activity, the purpose of this review is 
to present evidence on the possible role of HO-1 in these Central Nervous System 
(CNS) diseases. In addition, the possible therapeutic potential of targeting 
brain HO-1 is explored in this review.
