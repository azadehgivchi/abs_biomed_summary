The widespread use of aspirin-driven vascular prevention strategies does not impede the occurrence of first and recurrent ischemic strokes in numerous subjects. It is not clear what factors are associated with aspirin failure beyond the functional diagnosis of aspirin resistance in selected subjects. Current management guidelines provide little or no recommendations on the proper strategy for subjects who had a stroke while receiving aspirin. We assessed clinical features of subjects who had a first or recurrent stroke while taking aspirin.
We studied demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, stroke subtypes, and concomitant medication use in subjects with first or recurrent ischemic strokes. Patients receiving antiplatelet medications other than aspirin and/or oral anticoagulants were excluded from this analysis.
Seven hundred and nine patients with first (n = 552) or recurrent (n = 157) ischemic stroke were evaluated. Aspirin was being taken by 29% of first and 48% of recurrent stroke subjects. There was a higher prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking in aspirin users with first and recurrent stroke (P < .05). Diabetes and coronary artery disease were more frequent in aspirin users with first ischemic strokes (P < .003), but not in those who had recurrent ischemic strokes. Aspirin users were more likely to be also receiving statins and antihypertensive drugs (P < .001).
Aspirin failure in ischemic stroke prevention may exceed functional resistance to aspirin and could be associated with a higher prevalence of lacunar stroke, comorbidities, and/or adverse interactions with other drugs. These patients may require a different approach regarding prevention strategies.
