Approximately one in five individuals in the United States experiences mental 
health issues in any given year, and these disorders are consistently among the 
leading causes of years lived with disability. Unfortunately, many mental 
illnesses are lifelong conditions that require medication and therapy to improve 
quality of life, yet clinical trial data show that many patients fail to achieve 
remission or require several pharmacological interventions prior to remission. 
These results indicate a need to address the variability among patients in their 
response to medication, in addition to developing treatment plans tailored to 
the individual. One approach that may help explain patient variability in 
response to medication is pharmacogenetic testing. The current review shows the 
clinical use of pharmacogenetic testing in a small subset of gene variants and 
how they pertain to psychiatric illness and treatment. Recent evidence suggests 
that genetic testing for psychiatric illness can improve patient outcomes in 
addition to decreasing health care costs. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and 
Mental Health Services, 56(1), 22-31.].
