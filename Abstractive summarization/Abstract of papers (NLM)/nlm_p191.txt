Hypertensive heart disease encompasses anatomical changes and altered physiology of heart muscle, coronary arteries, and great vessels. Left ventricular hypertrophy is not only a target organ response to increased afterload, but is also the most potent cardiovascular risk factor. Regression of hypertrophy reduces morbidity and mortality. Heart failure may be present in the absence of a reduction of myocardial contractility. Ischemic heart disease occurs in the absence of epicardial coronary disease. Left atrial size and atrial fibrillation are associated. Potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are more common in hypertensive patients. The relationship of aortic root size to blood pressure is weaker than expected; however, the relationship to aortic dissection is stronger. Careful attention and treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and atrial fibrillation will improve survival.
