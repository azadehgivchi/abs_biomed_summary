The purpose of this work is to present the approach to mental disorders in 
Moroccan patients from a sociocultural perspective. The anthropology of health 
and ethno-psychiatry will allow us to analyze the concepts of health and 
disease. From the Moroccan cosmovision we will analyze the alternative 
treatments and their association with other therapeutic models.
