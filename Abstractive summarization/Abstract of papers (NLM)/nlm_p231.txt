Review: In our country, mental disorders in emergency situations began 
to be studied especially intensively after the Chernobyl disaster. A 
considerable amount of research is devoted to this issue. Neuropsychiatric and 
psychoneurological disorders were analyzed carefully and it was established that 
in those people who were in the enhanced radiation zone, mental maladaptation 
arose due to psychological traumas, but not because of ionizing radiation.
Art therapy turned out to be a popular activity for 
improving well-being, where the demobilized could do handmade work. Another good 
way to improve their mood was watching movies with a certain idea, sense. The 
most influential therapy is relaxation sessions, where the warriors can abstract 
their mind from everything and enjoy good music or landscapes. Among the group 
sessions, the "road to peace" theme was the most popular one, where veterans 
could communicate with a psychologist, express their thoughts and feelings, and, 
if necessary, consult for the future.
