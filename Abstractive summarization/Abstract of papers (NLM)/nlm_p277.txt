In Dutch mental health care there is an ongoing debate about the benefits of rom 
and utility of benchmarking. Opinions vary regarding the reliability and 
validity of performance indicators.<br/> AIM: Investigation of the reliability 
of the main indicator of Foundation Benchmark Mental Health Care (sbg), Delta-T, 
the indicator of treatment outcome.<br/> METHOD: The reliability was established 
with two indices: the intraclass correlation coefficient (icc) for the agreement 
between repeated assessments of average treatment outcome and the consistency in 
rank order of mental health care providers over time.<br/> RESULTS: The 
reliability of Delta-T proved to be excellent.<br/> CONCLUSION: Reliability is a 
basic requirement, but only the first step in establishing the utility of 
Delta-T. Further investigation of its validity is ongoing, especially on how 
robust treatment outcome is for bias due to instrumentation, selection, and 
confounding by casemix composition. Ultimately, the usefulness of treatment 
outcome as indicator of quality of care needs to be demonstrated in practice.
