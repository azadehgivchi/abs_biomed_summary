Biochemical imbalances, provoked by aging or a secondary illness, might directly 
affect the brain, causing severe problems, such as loss of memory or alteration 
of behavior patterns. Brain disorders are usually classified as injuries (such 
as stroke, hematomas, and concussions), tumors, and neurodegenerative (such as 
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases) and mental (such as depression, bipolar 
disorder, schizophrenia) diseases. As the pathophysiology of these illnesses is 
not completely established and multiple factors are involved, metallomics, a 
bioanalytical strategy that allows the detection of metal ions and 
metalloproteins in diverse biological matrices, is of extreme relevance in 
identifying which elements are affected by a disease and/or treatment. Thus, 
determining which element ions suffer disturbances in their homeostasis during 
the disease progress is relevant to understand the biochemical changes and 
propose new drug targets. In addition, it is well known that oxidative stress 
plays an important role in the development of pathological neurodegenerative and 
mental diseases, which may be caused by metal ion dyshomeostasis, so it is also 
important to understand endogenous antioxidant metalloprotein and metalloenzyme 
mechanisms in this regard. In this context, recent applications of metallomics 
in the study of neurodegenerative and mental disorders are discussed in this 
chapter, as well as future trends in this research area.
