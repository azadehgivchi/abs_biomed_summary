Very few discoveries in the neurosciences have triggered clinical speculation 
and experimentation regarding the etiology of psychiatric illness to the same 
extent as that following identification of the opiate receptor(s) and subsequent 
isolation of endogenous morphine-like peptides. There is overwhelming evidence 
in animals and in human that opioids are involved in behaviorally relevant 
issues such as the modulation of pain, the response to stress, motivation, 
addiction, sexuality, food intake, etc., but our knowledge on the possible 
relation between opioids and mental illness is still very limited.These 
responses could be explored eitheir by using higlhy selective delta agonist or 
by emphasizing the effects of phasically secreted endogenous opioid peptides, 
enkephalin. Both approaches were investigated in particular through protection 
of enkephalin degradation by dual enkephalinase ihibitors DENKIs such as RB101, 
PL37 or PL265.
