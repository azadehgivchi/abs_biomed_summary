Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is customarily applied on a 
daily basis for prolonged periods of time for the treatment of psychiatric 
diseases. The process is demanding in terms of staff and patient time, and the 
onset of the effect is slow. Recently, intensive rTMS protocols have been 
introduced in which stimulation is applied to the same area more than once a day 
with a higher than standard number of pulses. This article reviews 16 articles 
to determine the safety and efficacy of such protocols. Intensive rTMS seems to 
be effective in various mental disorders. It appears to have, in general, the 
same adverse events as classic, long-term, daily rTMS, and it is largely well 
tolerated by the patients. One episode of depersonalization, one of increased 
suicidal thoughts, and two of induced mania were observed in the 16 studies 
reviewed. The advantages of intensive rTMS are in the possible acute effect of 
the stimulation and in the possible reduction in the time required to achieve 
remission in depression (and potentially other disorders). It remains uncertain 
whether intensive rTMS is more effective than sham stimulation or once-daily, 
long-term rTMS.
