Autoimmune encephalitis is a group of autoimmune inflammatory disorders 
affecting both grey and white matter of the central nervous system. Encephalitis 
with autoantibodies against the N‑methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) is the 
most frequent autoimmune encephalitis syndrome presenting with a characteristic 
sequence of psychiatric and neurological symptoms. Treatment necessitates a 
close interdisciplinary cooperation. This article provides an update on the 
current knowledge on diagnostic standards, pathogenesis, and treatment 
strategies for anti-NMDA-R encephalitis from psychiatric and neurological 
perspectives.
