Substance use disorders (SUD) and personality disorders co-occur frequently. 
This relationship might be understood by studying schema modes (a key concept in 
Schema therapy), which explain the dysfunctions characterizing personality 
disorder patients. In the present study, we compared the schema modes and 
personality disorder symptoms between alcohol-dependent patients, 
cocaine-dependent patients and healthy controls. We found indications that 
specific schema modes are specific for SUD patients. However, no differences 
between specific subtypes of SUD patients (alcohol- vs. cocaine-dependent 
patients) could be found regarding schema modes. Further, it is suggested that 
borderline personality disorder symptoms are highly relevant for SUD patients. A 
first step is made in understanding the relationship between schema modes and 
SUD, which may contribute to the understanding of the problematic behaviour seen 
in patients with personality disorders and SUD (and may possibly contribute to 
the improvement of the treatment of this group of patients).
