Chaining of people with mental disorders, and their incarceration and abuse in 
prisons or mental hospitals, is an affront to psychiatry and humanity. Although 
mental healthcare always needs attention to cultural and social contexts, this 
must never be at the cost of allowing human rights violations to go 
unchallenged. A rights-based approach must enforce well-established 
international human rights conventions, and scale-up comprehensive community 
services around the needs and preferences of people affected by mental 
disorders. Declaration of interest None.
