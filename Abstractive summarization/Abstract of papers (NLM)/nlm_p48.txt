To compile, review, and comment upon the application of psychotherapy to the treatment of psychiatric disorders first appearing in childhood and adolescence.
Representative research papers published over the past 4 decades on the subject of psychotherapy of children and adolescents were compiled. Selection for inclusion in this review was based upon salience to the subject of treatment of child psychiatric disorders. Special consideration was given to large-scale and metaanalytic studies, as well as to studies comparing psychotherapy with other forms of treatment.
There is mixed evidence for the efficacy of psychotherapy for child psychiatric disorders. There are few direct comparisons between treatment modalities in the child psychiatric literature. Methodological problems include a history of theoretical development of therapies without reference to current conceptions of mental illness, a paucity of direct comparisons among psychotherapies and between psychotherapy and other psychiatric treatments, inconsistent definition of psychotherapy from study to study, and inconsistency in stated outcome measures. In general, cognitive-behavioural therapies performed better in application to child psychiatric disorders than did insight-oriented therapies.
Outcome research in child-oriented psychotherapy is still in its infancy. There are simply too few studies of many therapies and many conditions to draw firm conclusions about efficacy. More work is needed in matching discrete, consistently applied therapies to selected psychiatric pathologies. Questions regarding psychotherapy's potential application to prevention of mental illness and to management of distress surrounding mental illness (as distinct from treatment of the illness itself) remain to be answered.
