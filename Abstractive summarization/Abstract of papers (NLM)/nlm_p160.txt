Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating illness causing already significant morbidity in childhood. Currently approved treatment options for children comprise the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan, as well as the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil. But PAH treatment has advanced significantly over the past decade, and new classes of targeted drug therapies, such as stimulators of the soluble guanylate cyclase (riociguat) or prostacyclin receptor agonists (selexipag), are currently evaluated regarding their efficacy and safety in children, in order to limit off-label use. Due to the different etiologies in children, such as PAH-CHD, there is no evidence that initial combination therapy in children is superior to a mono-therapy with respect to survival. Special attention should also be paid to the pharmacology of PAH drugs in children, which might be impacted by ontogeny or drug-drug-interactions. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be useful in pediatric patients. There is a clear need for more controlled studies of PAH medications, alone or in combination therapy in the pediatric age group. Data from clinical trials as well as from patient registries should be pooled to optimize drug development and evaluation, trial design, and evidence-based pharmacotherapy in pediatric patients with PAH. In this review, the current treatment options of pediatric PAH are summarized, and an overview of new treatment concepts, which are already evaluated in adults, is presented.
