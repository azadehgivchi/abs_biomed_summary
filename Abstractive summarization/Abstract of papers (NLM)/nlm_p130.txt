Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an injury to the brain caused by an external mechanical force, affecting millions of people worldwide. The disease course and prognosis are often unpredictable, and it can be challenging to determine an early diagnosis in case of mild injury as well as to accurately phenotype the injury. There is currently no cure for TBI-drugs having failed repeatedly in clinical trials-but an intense effort has been put to identify effective neuroprotective treatment. The detection of novel biomarkers, to understand more of the disease mechanism, facilitates early diagnosis, predicts disease progression, and develops molecularly targeted therapies that would be of high clinical interest. Over the last decade, there has been an increasing effort and initiative toward finding TBI-specific biomarker candidates. One promising strategy has been to use state-of-the-art neuroproteomics approaches to assess clinical biofluids and compare the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood proteome between TBI and control patients or between different subgroups of TBI. In this chapter, we summarize and discuss the status of biofluid proteomics in TBI, with a particular focus on the latest findings.
