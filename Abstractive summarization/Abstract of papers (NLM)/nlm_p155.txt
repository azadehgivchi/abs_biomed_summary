DNA methylation has been an important area of research in the study of molecular 
mechanism to psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence has suggested that 
abnormalities in global methylation, methylation of genes, and pathways could 
play a role in the etiology of many forms of mental illness. In this article, we 
review the mechanisms of DNA methylation, including the genetic and 
environmental factors affecting methylation changes. We report and discuss major 
findings regarding DNA methylation in psychiatric patients, both within the 
context of global methylation studies and gene-specific methylation studies. 
Finally, we discuss issues surrounding data quality improvement, the limitations 
of current methylation analysis methods, and the possibility of using DNA 
methylation-based treatment for psychiatric disorders in the future.
