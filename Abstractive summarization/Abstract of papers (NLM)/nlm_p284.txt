To examine the validity of diagnoses obtained by clinicians during routine 
clinical examination on acute psychiatric inpatient wards.
METHODS: N=100 inpatients with a broad spectrum of major mental disorders were 
randomly selected in a mental hospital's department of general psychiatry. 
Patients were diagnosed by independent assessors within Md = 5 (Range: 1-18) 
days of admission using the SCID I in order to examine the validity of the 
diagnoses given by the clinical staff based on routine assessments.
The commonly used clinical examination technique had good overall 
agreement with the SCID I assessments regarding primary diagnoses at the level 
of ICD-10 main categories (F2, F30-31, F32-F33, F4; κ = 0.65). However, 
agreement between routine clinical diagnoses and the SCID I diagnoses tended to 
be low for some specific mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders) and for 
secondary diagnoses.
The validity of routine clinical diagnoses established in acute 
inpatient settings is limited and should be improved.
