To explore the relationship between occupational stress and 
psychological disorder among oilfield workers.
METHODS: In 2013, 1485 psychological normal oilfield workers using the 
stratified cluster sampling in Xinjiang Autonomous Region were investigated, and 
the follow-up was conducted in 2015. Occupational stress and mental health 
status were assessed by questionnaire for the occupation stress and self-rating 
symptom.
The people with mental disorder was 556, the incidence rate was40. 29%. 
The level of occupational stress level low-high group( RR = 2. 689, 95% CI1. 
342-5. 391) and middle-high group( RR = 2. 878, 95% CI 1. 205-6. 875) of mental 
disorder were higher than the low-low group, the level of Personal Strain 
Questionnaire low-middle group( RR = 2. 500, 95% CI 1. 700-3. 763) and low-high 
group( RR =3. 907, 95% CI 1. 955-7. 651) and middle-middle group( RR = 2. 141, 
95% CI 1. 016-4. 512) of mental disorder were higher than low-low group. Without 
drinking( RR =0. 779, 95% CI = 0. 622-0. 976) was protective factor for mental 
disorders.
Occupational stress and drinking are the risk factors of mental 
disorder, it is more practical to multiple measurement of the psychological 
disorder of occupational stress exposure than single one.
