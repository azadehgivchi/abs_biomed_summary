We aimed to explore beliefs about physical health from the perspective of 
patients with concurrent mental illness and substance use and to explore how a 
health promotion intervention influenced their personal agency for changing 
health-related behaviour. Our findings were that patients' beliefs were focused 
on their present day state of health and that patients had strategies to 
normalize their health and health-related behaviour. Health promotion to this 
group of patients should be tailored to fit their particular beliefs. Health 
measurements were experienced as providing tangible insight into their health 
and appeared to prevent patients from minimizing physical health problems.
