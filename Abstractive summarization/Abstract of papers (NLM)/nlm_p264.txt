Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder worldwide, which affects more 
than 300 million people. We aimed to detect depressed patients and healthy 
people automatically. We work on the PHQ-9 questionnaires and reduced it to a 
PHQ-5 questionnaires with a new cut-off value of 8 to detect depressed patients. 
We trained a Neural Network with 70% of our dataset. Then, the proposed 
classifier was tested with two datasets. The first one consists of 30% of PHQ-5 
datasets, which could achieve 85.69%, 99.11% and 90.56% for accuracy, 
sensitivity and specificity respectively. The second test dataset consists of 
physical patient's parameters which recorded during a study in the Hanover 
Medical School. This classifier has shown good results in the detection of 
depression based on these two datasets.
