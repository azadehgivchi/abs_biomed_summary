Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are self-rated, but may not take in 
other aspects of the patient's perspective, such as the inclusion of domains 
that reflect service-user priorities. The clinician's view still has priority, 
although this situation has shifted in recent years. The Recovering Quality of 
Life (ReQoL) offers an advance in this area. Declaration of interest None.
