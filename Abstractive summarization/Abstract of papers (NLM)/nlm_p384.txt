Personalised medicine promises to provide us with a diagnostic predictive system 
of stratification that is based on a wide variety of tests; these can include 
biological, cognitive, demographic, psychopathological tests and other clearly 
defined tests. The purpose of forensic psychiatry is not only to take care of 
and treat mentally impaired patients but also to engage in risk assessment and 
risk management.<br/> AIM: To explain risk assessment in forensic psychiatry as 
a nomothetic approach to personalised medicine, and also to demonstrate the link 
with offence paralleling behaviour, which is an illustration of the ideographic 
approach.<br/> METHOD: A discussion of recent literature and insights into risk 
assessment, risk management and offence paralleling behaviour.<br/> RESULTS: 
Risk assessment helps us to divide patients into groups according to the risk of 
recidivism. The nomothetic concept is the basis of most risk assessment 
instruments. One of the most important tasks in risk management in forensic 
psychiatry is to reduce the risk factors and strengthen the influence of 
protective factors. The model of offence paralleling behaviour resembles in many 
respects the concept of integrating risk management and treatment, but shows 
more precisely how hypotheses can be tested in a clinical context.<br/> 
CONCLUSION: In view of the great importance to society of preventing offences, 
forensic psychiatry is leading the way in the application of personalised 
medicine in psychiatry.
