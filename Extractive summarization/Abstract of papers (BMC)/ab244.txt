Background: We tested the hypotheses that: 1) early exposure to increasing episodes of clinically relevant
intermittent hypoxia (IH) is detrimental to the developing kidneys; and 2) there is a critical number of daily IH
episodes which will result in irreparable renal damage that may involve angiotensin (Ang) II and endothelin (ET)-1.
Methods: At birth (P0), neonatal rat pups were exposed to brief IH episodes from the first day of life (P0) to P7 or
from P0-P14. Pups were either euthanized immediately or placed in room air (RA) until P21. RA littermates served as
controls. Kidneys were harvested at P7, P14, and P21 for histopathology; angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE-
2, ET-1, big ET-1, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels; immunoreactivity of ACE, ACE-2, ET-1, ET-2, ET receptors (ETAR,
ETBR), and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)1α; and apoptosis (TUNEL stain).
Results: Histopathology showed increased renal damage with 8–12 IH episodes/day, and was associated with Ang
II, ACE, HIF1α, and apoptosis. ACE-2 was not expressed at P7, and minimally increased at P14. However, a robust
ACE-2 response was seen during recovery with maximum levels noted in the groups recovering from 8 IH
episodes/day. ET-1, big ET-1, ETAR, ETBR, and MDA increased with increasing levels of neonatal IH.
Conclusions: Chronic neonatal IH causes severe damage to the developing kidney with associated elevations in
vasoconstrictors, suggesting hypertension, particularly with 8 neonatal IH episodes. ACE-2 is not activated in early
postnatal life, and this may contribute to IH-induced vasoconstriction. Therapeutic targeting of ACE and ET-1 may
help decrease the risk for kidney injury in the developing neonate to prevent and/or treat neonatal acute kidney
injury and/or chronic kidney disease.
