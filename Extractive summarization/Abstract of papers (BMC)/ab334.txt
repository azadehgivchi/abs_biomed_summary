Background: We aimed to evaluate the clinical value of copy number variation-sequencing (CNV-Seq) in
combination with cytogenetic karyotyping in prenatal diagnosis.
Methods: CNV-Seq and cytogenetic karyotyping were performed in parallel for 9452 prenatal samples for
comparison of the diagnostic performance of the two methods, and to evaluate the screening performance of
maternal age, maternal serum screening, fetal ultrasound scanning and noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for fetal
pathogenic copy number variation (CNV).
Results: Among the 9452 prenatal samples, traditional karyotyping detected 704 cases (7.5%) of abnormal
cytogenetic karyotypes, 171 (1.8%) chromosome polymorphism, 20 (0.2%) subtle structural variations, 74 (0.7%)
mutual translocation (possibly balanced), 52 (0.6%) without karyotyping results, and 8431 (89.2%) normal
cytogenetic karyotypes. Among the 8705 cases with normal karyotype, polymorphism, mutual translocation, or
marker chromosome, CNV-Seq detected 63 cases (0.7%) of pathogenic chromosome microdeletion/duplication.
Retrospectively, noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) had high sensitivity and specificity for the screening of fetal
pathogenic CNV, and NIPT combining with maternal age, maternal serum screening or fetal ultrasound scanning,
which improved the screening performance.
Conclusion: The combined application of cytogenetic karyotyping and CNV-Seq significantly improved the
detection rate of fetal pathogenic chromosome microdeletion/duplication. NIPT was recommended for the
screening of pathogenic chromosome microdeletion/duplication, and NIPT combining with other screening
methods further improved the screening performance for pathogenic fetal CNV.
