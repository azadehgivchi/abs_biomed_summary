Background: Joint torques are generally of primary importance for clinicians to analyze the effect of a surgery
and to obtain an indicator of functional capability to perform a motion. Given the current need to standardize
the functional evaluation of the upper limb, the aim of this paper is to assess (1) the variability of the calculated
maximal elbow joint torque during cyclic elbow flexion-extension movements and (2) participant test-retest
repeatability in healthy young adults. Calculations were based on an existing non-invasive method including
kinematic identification and inverse dynamics processes.
Methods: Twelve healthy young adults (male n = 6) performed 10 elbow flexion-extension movement carrying five
different dumbbells (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 kg) with several flexion-extension frequencies (½, 1/3, ¼ Hz) to evaluate peak
elbow joint torques.
Results: Whatever the condition, the variability coefficient of trial peak torques remained under 4 %. Bland and
Altman plot also showed good test-retest, whatever the frequency conditions for the 0, 1, 2, and 3 kg conditions.
Conclusion: The good repeatability of the flexion-extension peak torques represents a key step to standardize the
functional evaluation of the upper limb.
