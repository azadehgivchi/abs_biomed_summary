Background: There is wide variation in clinical practice for the early detection of prostate cancer, not least because
of the ongoing debate about the benefits of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. In this study, we aimed to
assess the approaches, attitudes, and knowledge of general practitioners (GPs) regarding PSA testing in primary
care in the Netherlands, particularly regarding recommendations for prostate cancer.
Methods: Questionnaire surveys were sent to 179 GPs in the north-east of the Netherlands, of which 65 (36%) were
completed and returned. We also surveyed 23 GPs attending a postgraduate train-the-trainer day (100%). In
addition to demographic data and practice characteristics, the 31-item questionnaire covered the attitudes, clinical
practice, adherence to PSA screening recommendations, and knowledge concerning the recommendations for
prostate cancer early detection. Statistical analysis was limited to the descriptive level.
Results: Most GPs (95%; n = 82) stated that they had at least read the Dutch GP guideline, but just half (50%; n =
43) also stated that they knew the content. Almost half (46%; n = 39) stated they would offer detailed counseling
before ordering a PSA test to an asymptomatic man requesting a test. Overall, prostate cancer screening was
reported to be of minor importance compared to other types of cancer screening.
Conclusions: Clinical PSA testing in primary care in this region of the Netherlands seems generally to be consistent
with the relevant guideline for Dutch GPs that is restrictive to PSA testing. The next step will be to further evaluate
the effects of the several PSA testing strategies.
