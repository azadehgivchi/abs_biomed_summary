Background: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular
transmission. The objective was to examine the efficacy and safety of 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) in patients with LEMS.
Methods: We searched several databases to identify relevant studies, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science,
MEDLINE, Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials(CENTRAL). The primary outcome, quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score and the secondary outcome,
compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) amplitude were pooled by meta-analysis.
Results: Six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 115 patients with LEMS were included. QMG score showed a
significant decrease (improvement) of 2.76 points (95 % CI, -4.08 to -1.45, p < 0.001) after treatment with 3, 4-DAP.
Moreover, the overall mean CMAP amplitude improved significantly in LEMS patients with 3, 4-DAP treatment, compared
with placebo treatment (mean difference 1.34 mV, 95 % CI, 0.98 to 1.70, p< 0.001). The overall assessment of all included
trials showed a low risk of bias and low heterogeneity.
Conclusions: The pooled results of RCTs demonsrated with moderate to high evidence that 3,4-DAP has a significant
effect on LEMS treatment, with improvements in muscle strength score and CMAP amplitude.
