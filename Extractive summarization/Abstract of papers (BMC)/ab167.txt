Background: Unlike salmonellosis with well-known routes of transmission, the epidemiology of
campylobacteriosis is still largely unclear. Known risk factors such as ingestion of contaminated
food and water, direct contact with infected animals and outdoor swimming could at most only
explain half the recorded cases.
Discussion: We put forward the hypothesis that flies play a more important role in the
transmission of the bacteria, than has previously been recognized. Factors supporting this
hypothesis are: 1) the low infective dose of Campylobacter; 2) the ability of flies to function as
mechanical vectors; 3) a ubiquitous presence of the bacteria in the environment; 4) a seasonality of
the disease with summer peaks in temperate regions and a more evenly distribution over the year
in the tropics; 5) an age pattern for campylobacteriosis in western travellers to the tropics
suggesting other routes of transmission than food or water; and finally 6) very few family clusters.
Summary: All the evidence in favour of the fly hypothesis is circumstantial and there may be
alternative explanations to each of the findings supporting the hypothesis. However, in the absence
of alternative explanations that could give better clues to the evasive epidemiology of Campylobacter
infection, we believe it would be unwise to rule out flies as important mechanical vectors also of
this disease.
