Background: To examine the characteristics of rhegmatous retinal detachment (RRD) associated with atopic
dermatitis.
Method: Medical records of 2257 patients who underwent RD surgery at this clinic between 2008 and 2018 were
retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 61 patients who were diagnosed as AD were assigned into the experimental
group and 100 patients who did not have AD were randomly selected and assigned into the control group.
Demographics, characteristics of detachment, initial operative method, and prognosis after surgery were investigated
as main outcomes. Additionally, in pseudophakic RD patients, the period between the cataract surgery and onset of
RD was measured.
Result: Postoperative VA and prognosis were signifcantly worse and bilateral involvement of RD was more common
in the atopy group than in the control group. (P value=0.005, 0.001 each) Characteristics of retinal breaks were difer‑
ent between the two groups. Additionally, the risk of developing RD within 1 year after cataract surgery was signif‑
cantly higher in pseudophakic patients of the atopic group than in the control group. (P value=0.013) However, there
was no signifcant diference in mean preoperative VA or refractive index between the two groups.
Conclusion: Our results show that in atopic patients, RD occurs at a young age with diferent characteristics com‑
pared to non-atopic patients. Atopic RD has a poor visual prognosis. Thus, it requires careful management. Further‑
more, the risk of developing RD within 1 year after cataract surgery is higher in atopic patients. Therefore, it is impor‑
tant to perform regular and extensive check-up after cataract surgery for atopic patients.
