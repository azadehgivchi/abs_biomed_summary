Background: Management of bowel traumatic injuries is a challenge. Although anastomotic or suture leak remains
a feared complication, preserving bowel continuity is increasingly the preferred strategy. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the outcomes of such a strategy.
Methods: All included patients underwent surgery for bowel traumatic injuries at a high volume trauma center
between 2007 and 2017. Postoperative course was analyzed for abdominal complications, morbidity and mortality.
Results: Among 133 patients, 78% had small bowel injuries and 47% had colon injuries. 87% of small bowel injuries
and 81% of colon injuries were treated with primary repair or anastomosis, with no difference in treatment according
to injury site (p = 0.381). Mortality was 8%. Severe overall morbidity was 32%, and abdominal complications occurred
in 32% of patients. Risk factors for severe overall morbidity were stoma creation (p = 0.036), heavy vascular expansion
(p = 0.005) and a long delay before surgery (p = 0.023). Fistula rate was 2.2%; all leaks occurred after repairing small
bowel wounds.
Conclusion: Primary repair of bowel injuries should be the preferred option in trauma patient, regardless of the
site—small bowel or colon—of the injury. Stoma creation is an important factor for postoperative morbidity, which
should be weighed against the risk of an intestinal suture or anastomosis.
