Background: People with an intellectual disability experience higher rates of mental health problems, but experience
significant barriers to receiving professional help. Increasing the knowledge and skills of those who support
them can help to reduce some of these barriers. This study aimed to develop guidelines for offering mental health
first aid to a person with an intellectual disability.
Methods: Using the Delphi research method, a systematic search of websites, books and journal articles was conducted
to develop a survey containing items about the knowledge, skills and actions needed for assisting a person
with an intellectual disability who is experiencing mental health problems. These items were rated over three survey
rounds by an expert panel according to whether they should be included in the guidelines.
Results: Fifty-three experts completed all three survey rounds (67% retention rate). A total of 202 items were rated
over the three rounds to yield 170 endorsed items that were incorporated into the guidelines. The developed guidelines
emphasise the need to recognise the unique signs of mental health problems in people with an intellectual
disability, and provide appropriate support, communication and respect for people with an intellectual disability. The
guidelines will also build the capacity of carers to address behaviours of concern, socially limiting behaviours or seeking
professional help when the need arises. The guidelines will be used to develop a mental health first aid course.
Conclusion: The guidelines and the resultant mental health first aid course will be a helpful resource with the
potential to address some of the barriers to mental health help-seeking that people with an intellectual disability
experience.
