Objective: The present work aimed at determining the prevalence of menopausal symptoms and factors associated
with the Quality of life among postmenopausal women.
Materials and methods: This cross-sectional work was carried out on 270 postmenopausal females referring to
health centers of Hamadan city chosen by stratified random sampling. A questionnaire of the Menopausal Quality
of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) was used as the data collection method. Although, the Mann–Whitney test and the
Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to compare MENQOL item scores. The significance level of statistical tests was regarded
as less than 0.05.
Results: The mean MENQOL Score in menopausal was 2.45 ± 1.04. Also, vasomotor symptoms had the highest score,
and sexual symptoms had the lowest score rather than other dimensions. There was a significant association between
the total menopausal quality of life score and job, economy status, smoking, exercise, supplemental Omega-3 s
intake, and Postmenopausal stage (p < 0.01). As smokers, women had increasing levels of bother experienced from
the MENQOL symptom than non-smokers (mean = 3.67 ± 0.85 vs. 2.36 ± 0.99; p < 0.001). While the MENQOL scores
for menopausal females who exercised more often (mean = 1.56 ± 0.7) had lower than those who exercised less than
3 times per week (mean = 3.27 ± 0.9; p < 0.001). However the lowest score was menopausal females who had taking
supplemental Omega-3 s than those who hadn’t taken it (mean = 2.15 ± 1.06 vs. 2.65 ± 0.97; p < 0.001). Though
women who had postmenopausal stage less than 5 years stage (mean = 2.28 ± 0.87) had significantly lower MENQOL
scores from those who had postmenopausal stage 5 or more years (mean = 2.63 ± 1.16; p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Based on the results, vasomotor symptoms were the most dominant symptom. Therefore, it is necessary
to improve physical activity levels, focusing on job status, recommend taking an omega 3 s supplement, and planning
education and promotion intervention for cessation or prevention of smoking among postmenopausal women to
increase the MENQOL is essential.
