Abstract
Background: Despite research efforts, the causative factors that contribute to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(ESCC) in high-risk areas have not yet been understood. In this study, we, therefore, aimed to describe the risk
factors associated with ESCC and its precursor lesions.
Methods: We performed an endoscopic examination of 44,857 individuals aged 40–69 years from five high
incidence regions of China in 2017–2018. Participants were classified as 4 groups of normal control, esophagitis,
low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN) and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia/esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (HGIN/ESCC) using an unconditional logistic regression determine risk factors.
Results: We identified 4890 esophagitis, 1874 LGIN and 437 HGIN/ESCC cases. Crude odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted
odds ratios were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. Drinking well and surface water, salty diet, and
positive family history of cancer were the common risk factors for esophagitis, LGIN and HGIN/ESCC. History of
chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis was the greatest risk factor of esophagitis (adjusted OR 2.96, 95%CI 2.52–3.47) and HGIN/
ESCC (adjusted OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.03–3.22). Pesticide exposure (adjusted OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.05–1.37) was essential risk
factor of LGIN.
