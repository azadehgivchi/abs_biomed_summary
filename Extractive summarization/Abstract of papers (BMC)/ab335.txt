Background: We aimed to assess the correlation between vitamin D serum level and visceral fat tissue during early
pregnancy.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in Pernambuco, Brazil. 190 low risk pregnant women (8–16
gestational weeks) were eligible. Visceral adipose tissue was measured by ultrasonography following the technique
described by Armellini. The 25(OH) D in serum was determined through chemiluminescence. The Spearman
correlation test was applied to evaluate the correlation between vitamin D serum level and VAT, considering p <
0.05 to be significant.
Results: Vitamin D insufficiency was present in 129 (67.8 %) of subjects. Pregnant women with or without vitamin
D deficiency did not differ in age, gestational age, nutritional status and visceral adipose tissue. No correlation
between visceral adipose tissue and 25(OH) D was observed: − 0.057 (p = 0.435).
Conclusions: Maternal visceral adipose tissue and vitamin D serum level are not correlated during pregnancy.
