Abstract
Background: Predicting difficult airway is challengeable in patients with limited airway evaluation. The aim of this
study is to develop and validate a model that predicts difficult laryngoscopy by machine learning of neck
circumference and thyromental height as predictors that can be used even for patients with limited airway
evaluation.
Methods: Variables for prediction of difficulty laryngoscopy included age, sex, height, weight, body mass index,
neck circumference, and thyromental distance. Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as Grade 3 and 4 by the
Cormack-Lehane classification. The preanesthesia and anesthesia data of 1677 patients who had undergone general
anesthesia at a single center were collected. The data set was randomly stratified into a training set (80%) and a
test set (20%), with equal distribution of difficulty laryngoscopy. The training data sets were trained with five
algorithms (logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and light gradient
boosting machine). The prediction models were validated through a test set.
Results: The model’s performance using random forest was best (area under receiver operating characteristic
curve = 0.79 [95% confidence interval: 0.72–0.86], area under precision-recall curve = 0.32 [95% confidence interval:
0.27–0.37]).
Conclusions: Machine learning can predict difficult laryngoscopy through a combination of several predictors
including neck circumference and thyromental height. The performance of the model can be improved with more
data, a new variable and combination of models.
