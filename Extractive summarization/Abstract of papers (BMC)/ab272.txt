Background: Overweight and obesity have increased considerably in low- and middle-income countries over the
past few decades, particularly among women of reproductive age. This study assessed the role of physical activity,
nutrient intake and risk factors for overweight and obesity among women in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 1004 women aged 15–49 years in the Dar es Salaam
Urban Cohort Study (DUCS) from September 2018 to January 2019. Dietary intake was assessed using a food
frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Physical activity was assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire
(GPAQ) using metabolic equivalent tasks (MET). Modified poison regression models were used to evaluate
associations between physical activity and nutrient intake with overweight/obesity in women, controlling for
energy and other factors.
Results: The mean (±SD) age of study women was 30.2 (±8.1) years. Prevalence of overweight and obesity was
high (50.4%), and underweight was 8.6%. The risk of overweight/obesity was higher among older women (35–49 vs
15–24 years: PR 1.59; 95% CI: 1.30–1.95); women of higher wealth status (PR 1.24; 95% CI: 1.07–1.43); and informally
employed and married women. Attaining moderate to high physical activity (≥600 MET) was inversely associated
with overweight/obesity (PR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63–0.99). Dietary sugar intake (PR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.03–1.58) was associated
with increased risk, and fish and poultry consumption (PR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61–0.99) with lower risk of overweight/
obesity.
Conclusion: Lifestyle (low physical activity and high sugar intake), age, wealth status, informal employment and
marital status were associated with increased risk of overweight/obesity, while consumption of fish and poultry
protein was associated with lower risk. The study findings underscore the need to design feasible and high-impact
interventions to address physical activity and healthy diets among women in Tanzania.
