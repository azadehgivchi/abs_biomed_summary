Background: To report current worldwide variation in techniques and clinical practice of flexible ureteroscopy
(FURS) among endourologists of different case volumes per year.
Methods: Two invitations to complete an internet survey were emailed to Endourological Society members. Some
of survey questions asked about indications of using FURS for renal and upper ureteral stones. Others were
concerned with clinical practice of FURS (such as preoperative stenting, use of ureteral access sheath (UAS) and
safety guidewire, technique of Laser lithotripsy and fragment retrieval, and post-FURS stenting. Responders were
distributed into two groups; high-volume (> 100 cases/year) and low-volume surgeons (< 100 cases/year) and data
were compared between both groups.
Results: Responses were received from 146 endourologists all over the world (62 high-volume and 84 low-volume).
FURS for intrarenal stone > 20mm was used by 61% of high-volume surgeons compared with 28.6% for low-volume
(P < 0.001). Semirigid URS was used for upper ureteric stones in 68% among high-volume group and 82% in lowvolume
group (P = 0.044). UAS was used by 62% in low-volume group and 69% in high volume group (P = 0.516).
Laser stone dusting was preferred by 63% in low-volume group versus 45% by high-volume (P = 0.031). More
responders in low-volume group preferred to leave the stent for 6 weeks (P = 0.042).
Conclusions: The use of FURS for treating upper tract calculi has expanded by high volume endourologists to include
large renal stones > 20mm. Low-volume surgeons prefer to use semi-rigid URS for treatment of upper ureteral stones,
to apply Laser stone dusting and maintain ureteral stents for longer periods.
