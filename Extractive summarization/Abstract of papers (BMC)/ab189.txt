Background: South Africa has made great progress in the development of HIV/AIDS testing, treatment and
prevention campaigns. Yet, it is clear that prevention and treatment campaigns alone are not enough to bring this
epidemic under control.
Discussion: News that the “Berlin patient” and the “Mississippi baby” have both been “cured” of HIV brought hope
to people living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa that a cure for HIV/AIDS is within reach. Despite the recent setbacks
announced in the “Mississippi Baby” case, protocols aimed at curing HIV/AIDS are being developed in South Africa.
However with evidence to suggest that participants in clinical trials do not understand the basic concepts in the
informed consent process, there is concern that future participants in HIV/AIDS cure research will lack comprehension
of the basic elements of future clinical trials that aims to cure HIV/AIDS and confuse research with clinical care.
Summary: Research ethics committees have an important role to play in ensuring that participants understand the
basic concepts discussed in the informed consent process, that they understand that research is not clinical care and
they are unlikely to benefit from any early phase trials seeking to cure HIV/AIDS.
