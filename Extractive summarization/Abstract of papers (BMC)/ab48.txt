Background: It is unclear whether transverse uterine incision is non-inferior to longitudinal incision during myomectomy
with regard to bleeding. Our aim was to compare between transverse and longitudinal uterine incisions in
myomectomy.
Methods: A parallel randomized controlled single-blinded study in a university affiliated hospital, in the period
between January 2017 and April 2018, in which 52 women candidates for abdominal myomectomy were randomized
into transverse uterine incision or longitudinal uterine incision groups (26 in each group). Intraoperative blood loss
(estimated directly by blood volume in suction bottle and linen towels and indirectly by difference between preoperative
and postoperative hematocrit), operative time and postoperative fever were analyzed.
Results: No statistically significant difference was found between transverse and longitudinal incisions regarding
intraoperative blood loss (389.7 ± 98.56 ml vs 485.04 ± 230.6 ml respectively, p value = 0.07), operative time
(59.96 ± 16.78 min vs 66.58 ± 17.33 min respectively, p value = 0.18), and postoperative fever (4% vs 8.33%, p
value = 0.6).
Conclusion: Transverse uterine incision does not cause more blood loss than longitudinal incision and is a reasonable
option during abdominal myomectomy.
