Introduction: This article is a report of designing a rapid and effective guide for paramedics who take care of
patients in a pre-hospital setting to answer developing demands.
Methods: The relevant literature was reviewed, and the topics were extracted. Then, the extracted items were
discussed in an expert panel. Finally, items were discussed in a meeting including emergency technicians and
emergency technical assistants to identify implementation problems.
Results: Important topics for managing psychiatric patients were categorized at three levels: 1) Patient safety and
security issues, 2) Patient status assessment and diagnosis, and 3) Patient management (medical, behavioral
management, and referral to a treatment center).
Discussion: This protocol can be a solution to improve emergency technician training. Such summarized protocols
can be used for rapid review immediately before exposing a patient with an acute psychiatric condition. Due to
specific cultural and different access to medicines in Iran, some issues are different.
