Purpose: To investigate the changes of cough sensitivity in patients with metabolic syndrome and its possible
mechanisms.
Method: A total of 29 metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients with OSAHS (group-1), 22 MetS patients without OSAHS
(group-2), and 25 healthy controls (group-3) were included. All participants underwent a routine physical examination
and completed the gastroesophageal refux disease questionnaire (GerdQ), and the infammatory mediator profle
were determined. The cough threshold for capsaicin, induced sputum cell count and cell classifcation, and infammatory mediators in induced sputum supernatants were compared. The correlation between capsaicin cough sensitivity
and various indicators in the MetS population was analyzed.
Results: The minimum concentration of inhaled capsaicin needed to induceâ‰¥5 coughs (C5) was signifcantly different among three groups (H=14.393, P=0.001) and lower for group-1 and group-2 than it for group-3 (P=0.002,
P=0.005). The percentage of neutrophils in induced sputum and the concentrations of calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) in the sputum supernatant of group-1 and group-2 were
signifcantly higher than those of group-3. Besides, the pepsin concentrations were signifcantly diferent among the 3
groups (F=129.362, P<0.001), which signifcantly was highest in group-1 (P<0.001) and lowest in group-3 (P<0.001).
Triglycerides, AHI, pepsin concentration and BMI were risk factors of increased capsaicin cough sensitivity.
Conclusion: Increased capsaicin cough sensitivity in MetS patients is closely related to sleep apnea and gastroesophageal refux. For patients in MetS patients without OSAHS, gastroesophageal refux is an important factor for increased
capsaicin cough sensitivity. Airway infammation, especially airway neurogenic infammation, may also play a role in
the pathogenesis of increased capsaicin cough sensitivity.
