Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and critical complication of liver transplantation (LT), which is
associated with increased morbidity, mortality and health care cost. We aimed to identify modifiable risk factors of
AKI after LT.
Methods: A literature search of Pubmed, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases was performed to identify studies
investigating risk factors of AKI after LT. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to rate study quality. Effect size and
95% confidence interval were pooled using a random-effect model with inverse-variance method.
Results: Sixty-seven articles with 28,844 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Seventeen modifiable risk
factors were found, including overweight, preoperative use of diuretic, preoperative anemia, donation after cardiac
death organ, donor BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/m2, ABO-incompatible LT, low graft to recipient body weight ratio, intraoperative
hypotension, major bleeding, intraoperative use of vasopressor, large RBC transfusion, postreperfusion syndrome,
postoperative use of vasopressors, overexposure to calcineurin inhibitor, calcineurin inhibitor without
mycophenolate mofetil, graft dysfunction and infection. A total of 38 articles were included in the systematic
review, in which 8 modifiable risk factors and 1 protective factor were additionally associated in single studies with
the incidence of AKI after LT.
Conclusions: Effective interventions based on identified modifiable risk factors in the perioperative management
and graft allocation and preservation may be promising to reduce the incidence of AKI after LT.
