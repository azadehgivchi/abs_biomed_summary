Background: The determination of the right x-ray angiography viewing angle is an important issue during the
treatment of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). An inaccurate projection angle (manually determined today
by the physicians according to their personal experience) may affect the placement of the stent and cause vascular
occlusion or endoleak.
Methods: Based on the acquisition of a computed tomography angiography (CTA) image before TEVAR, an adaptive
optimization algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal viewing angle of the angiogram automatically.
This optimal view aims at avoiding any overlapping between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian
artery. Moreover, the proposed optimal procedure exploits the patient-specific morphology to adaptively reduce the
potential foreshortening effect.
Results: Experimental results conducted on thirty-five patients demonstrate that the optimal angiographic viewing
angle based on the proposed method has no significant difference when compared with the expert practice
(p = 0.0678).
Conclusion: We propose a method that utilizes the CTA image acquired before TEVAR to automatically calculate
the optimal C-arm angle. This method has the potential to assist surgeons during their interventional procedure by
providing a shorter procedure time, less radiation exposure, and less contrast injection.
