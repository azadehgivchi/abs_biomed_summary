Background: The association between sexual and physical abuse and subsequent depression is well-established,
but the associations with specific depressive symptoms and sex differences remain relatively understudied. We
investigated the associations of sexual and physical abuse with depressive symptoms in men and women in a large
population cohort.
Methods: Observational study based on 151,396 UK Biobank participants. Exposures included self-reported
experiences of childhood physical abuse and sexual abuse. Mid-life outcomes included current depressive
symptoms score, individual depressive symptoms, and lifetime depression. We used logistic regression to test
associations of childhood sexual/physical abuse with depressive outcomes.
Results: Recalled childhood sexual and physical abuse were both associated with current depressive symptoms
score in adults. Results for individual symptoms-based analyses suggest that sexual and physical abuse are
associated with all depressive symptoms, particularly suicidal behaviours. The associations between lifetime
depression and sexual/physical abuse were not fully explained by current depressive symptoms score, indicating
that these findings may not be fully attributable to recall bias. There was no indication of differential risk for specific
depressive symptoms among men and women.
Conclusions: Sexual and physical abuse are robust risk factors for depression/depressive symptoms regardless of
sex. Higher risk of suicidal behaviours associated with childhood sexual/physical abuse are of particular concern.
Longitudinal research into sex-specific associations for individual depressive symptoms is required.
