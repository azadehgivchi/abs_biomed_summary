Background: Coagulation-related biomarkers are drawing new attention in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint
infection (PJI). The thromboelastography (TEG) assay provides a comprehensive assessment of blood coagulation;
therefore, it could be a promising test for PJI. This study aims to assess the value of TEG in diagnosing PJI and to
determine the clinical significance of TEG in analysing reimplantation timing for second-stage revision.
Methods: From October 2017 to September 2020, 62 patients who underwent revision arthroplasty were
prospectively included. PJI was defined by the 2011 Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria, in which 23 patients
were diagnosed with PJI (Group A), and the remaining 39 patients were included as having aseptic loosening
(Group B). In group A, 17 patients completed a two-stage revision in our centre. C-reactive protein (CRP),
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), D-dimer, and TEG parameters (clotting time, Î±-angle, MA [maximum
amplitude], amplitude at 30 min, and thrombodynamic potential index) were measured preoperatively in all
included patients. In addition, receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic value of
these biomarkers.
Results: ESR (area under curve [AUC], 0.953; sensitivity, 81.82; specificity, 94.87) performed best for PJI diagnosis,
followed by MA (AUC, 0.895; sensitivity, 82.61; specificity, 97.44) and CRP (AUC, 0.893; sensitivity, 82.61; specificity,
94.74). When these biomarkers were combined in pairs, the diagnostic value improved compared with any
individual biomarker. The overall success rate of the two-stage revision was 100%. Furthermore, ESR and MA were
valuable in determining the time of reimplantation, and their values all decreased below the cut-off values before
reimplantation.
Conclusion: TEG could be a promising test in assisting PJI diagnosis, and a useful tool in judging the proper timing
of reimplantation.
