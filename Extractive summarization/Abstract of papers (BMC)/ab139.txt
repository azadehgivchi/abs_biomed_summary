Background: While Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) ulcers has declined recently, H. pylori-negative and/or gastrotoxic
drug-negative peptic ulcers (HNGN-PU) has increased. This study aimed to analyze the etiology of peptic ulcers in
children and the differences in clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and histopathologic findings of peptic ulcers
according to etiology, including eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EoGE).
Methods: In total, 255 children (157 boys and 98 girls) with peptic ulcers were recruited. The subjects were
categorized into 5 groups according to the etiology of the ulcer: 1) H. pylori infection (n = 51); 2) gastrotoxic drugs
(n = 18); 3) idiopathic (n = 144); 4) systemic disease (n = 23); 5) EoGE (n = 19). Clinical data were reviewed and
analyzed retrospectively.
Results: Age at diagnosis, ulcer recurrence, atopic dermatitis history, white blood cell count, blood eosinophil
count, platelet count, serum albumin level, iron level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level
differed significantly among the 5 groups (all p < 0.05). Regarding endoscopic findings, multiple ulcers and gastric
mucosal nodularity differed among the 5 groups (all p < 0.05). When comparing the EoGE ulcer group with the
others, EoGE group revealed older ages (p = 0.022), higher rates of ulcer recurrence (p = 0.018), atopic dermatitis
history (p = 0.001), and both blood and tissue eosinophilia (both p = 0.001).
Conclusions: EoGE ulcers constituted 10.2% of HNGN-PU in pediatric patients. In children with HNGN-PU,
peripheral eosinophilia, ulcer recurrence, and atopic dermatitis history might imply EoGE, necessitating thorough
investigation of tissue eosinophils during endoscopic biopsy.
