Background: The diagnosis of Behçet disease (BD) is challenging in many cases. The purpose of this study was to
describe the clinical characteristics of patients at a referral BD clinic.
Methods: In a retrospective study, we collected data from patients at a national referral Behçet clinic from
November 2018–August 2019. A BD diagnosis was confirmed (BD group) or ruled out (Non-BD group), and the two
groups were compared for differences.
Results: A total of 238 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Forty patients (16.8%) were finally diagnosed with BD.
Ocular and genital lesions were significantly more prevalent in the BD group. A positive pathergy test and HLA-B51
were also significantly more common in BD. However, oral lesions, articular involvement, and gastrointestinal
manifestations were similar between groups. Also, patients with BD were significantly more likely to have multiorgan
(≥2 organ systems) involvement.
Conclusions: Being the first study to evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients who are visited at a referral BD
clinic and are believed to have a high probability of Behçet, the results of this study are important from an
epidemiological standpoint. Also, the findings of this study could be used by referral Behçet clinics, which evaluate
and diagnose patients with a high pretest probability and atypical presentations of BD on a daily basis. The
alternative diagnoses established in this study could be used as the list of the most common differential diagnoses
for Behçet’s disease.
