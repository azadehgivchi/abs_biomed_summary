Background: Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (aCAS) impairs haemodynamic and cognitive functions;
however, the relationship between these changes and brain network connectivity remains largely unknown. This
study aimed to determine the relationship between functional connectivity and neurocognition in patients with
aCAS.
Methods: We compared functional status in 14 patients with aCAS and 15 healthy controls using resting state
functional magnetic resonance imaging sequences. The subjects underwent a full range of neuropsychological tests
and a graphical theoretical analysis of their brain networks.
Results: Compared with controls, patients with aCAS showed significant decline in neuropsychological functions,
particularly short-term memory (word-memory, p = .046 and picture-memory, p = .014). Brain network connectivity
was lower in patients with aCAS than in the controls, and the decline of functional connectivity in aCAS patients
was mainly concentrated in the left and right inferior frontal gyri, temporal lobe, left cingulate gyrus, and
hippocampus. Decreased connectivity between various brain regions was significantly correlated with impaired
short-term memory. Patients with aCAS showed cognitive impairment independent of known vascular risk factors
for vascular cognitive impairment. The cognitive defects were mainly manifested in the short-term memory of
words and pictures.
Conclusions: This study is the first of its kind to identify an association between disruption of functional
connections in left carotid stenosis and impairment of short-term memory. The findings suggest that alterations in
network connectivity may be an essential mechanism underlying cognitive decline in aCAS patients.
