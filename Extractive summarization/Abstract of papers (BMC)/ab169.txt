Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia
(CAP). High global incidence of macrolide and penicillin resistance has been reported, whereas
fluoroquinolone resistance is uncommon. Current guidelines for suspected CAP in patients with
co-morbidity factors and recent antibiotic therapy recommend initial empiric therapy using one
fluoroquinolone or one macrolide associated to other drugs (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate,
broad-spectrum cephalosporins). Resistance to fluoroquinolones is determined by efflux
mechanisms and/or mutations in the parC and parE genes coding for topoisomerase IV and/or gyrA
and gyrB genes coding for DNA gyrase. No clinical cases due to fluoroquinolone-resistant S.
pneumoniae strains have been yet reported from Italy.
Case presentation: A 72-year-old patient with long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and multiple fluoroquinolone treatments for recurrent lower respiratory tract infections
developed fever, increased sputum production, and dyspnea. He was treated with oral levofloxacin
(500 mg bid). Three days later, because of acute respiratory insufficiency, the patient was
hospitalized. Levofloxacin treatment was supplemented with piperacillin/tazobactam.
Microbiological tests detected a S. pneumoniae strain intermediate to penicillin (MIC, 1 mg/L) and
resistant to macrolides (MIC >256 mg/L) and fluoroquinolones (MIC >32 mg/L). Point mutations
were detected in gyrA (Ser81-Phe), parE (Ile460-Val), and parC gene (Ser79-Phe; Lys137-Asn).
Complete clinical response followed treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam.
Conclusion: This is the first Italian case of community-acquired pneumonia due to a
fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae isolate where treatment failure of levofloxacin was
documented. Molecular analysis showed a group of mutations that have not yet been reported
from Italy and has been detected only twice in Europe. Treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam
appears an effective means to inhibit fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae causing
community-acquired pneumonia in seriously ill patients.
