Background: Household food insecurity (FI), even at marginal levels, is associated with poor child health outcomes.
The Nutrition Screening Tool for Every Preschooler (NutriSTEP®) is a valid and reliable 17-item parent-completed
measure of nutrition risk and includes a single item addressing FI which may be a useful child-specific screening
tool. We evaluated the diagnostic test properties of the single NutriSTEP® FI question using the 2-item Hunger Vital
Sign™ as the criterion measure in a primary care population of healthy children ages 18 months to 5 years.
Results: The sample included 1174 families, 53 (4.5%) of which were marginally food secure. An affirmative
response to the single NutriSTEP® question “I have difficulty buying food I want to feed my child because food is
expensive” had a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 91% and demonstrated good construct validity when
compared with the Hunger Vital Sign™.
Conclusion: The single NutriSTEP® question may be an effective screening tool in clinical practice to identify
marginal food security in families with young children and to link families with community-based services or
financial assistance programs including tax benefits.
