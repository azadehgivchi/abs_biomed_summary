Background: Extensive research describes how nurses experience their work environment. The conditions are
described as stressful and dissatisfying with nurses intending to leave their workplace. Knowledge about the
personal perception regarding why nurses consider leaving the hospital workplace is limited. The purpose of this
study was to understand why hospital nurses remain in their workplace, which facilitates their continuation in the
profession.
Objective: The objective was to explore and describe factors explaining why hospital nurses remain in the
workplace.
Methods: This was a descriptive qualitative study with a purposive sample of hospital nurses in Sweden. The
salutogenic theory was the basis for the interview guide and the semi-structured questions. Individual interviews
were conducted in a hospital in western Sweden. Content analysis was performed to organize the coded data
according to the sense of coherence.
Results: Data saturation was achieved with 12 interviews. Within the three themes of coherence (comprehensibility,
manageability, and meaningfulness), ten subthemes were categorized from the data as follows: job satisfaction and
fun at work, acknowledgement and productivity, togetherness and team security, manageable workload, variable
work and challenging situations, workplace and personal space balance, collaboration and supportive leadership,
valued role and good work, commitment and involvement, and pride in the professional role.
Conclusions: The main findings of this study have shown the critical importance of being in a meaningful,
comprehensible and manageable work context that supports nurses in maintaining their professional identity.
