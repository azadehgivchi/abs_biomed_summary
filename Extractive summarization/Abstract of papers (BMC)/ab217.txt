Background: Accurate, coded problem lists are valuable for data reuse, including clinical decision support and
research. However, healthcare providers frequently modify coded diagnoses by including or removing common
contextual properties in free-text diagnosis descriptions: uncertainty (suspected glaucoma), laterality (left glaucoma)
and temporality (glaucoma 2002). These contextual properties could cause a difference in meaning between underlying
diagnosis codes and modified descriptions, inhibiting data reuse. We therefore aimed to develop and evaluate an
algorithm to identify these contextual properties.
Methods: A rule-based algorithm called UnLaTem (Uncertainty, Laterality, Temporality) was developed using a
single-center dataset, including 288,935 diagnosis descriptions, of which 73,280 (25.4%) were modified by healthcare
providers. Internal validation of the algorithm was conducted with an independent sample of 980 unique records.
A second validation of the algorithm was conducted with 996 records from a Dutch multicenter dataset including
175,210 modified descriptions of five hospitals. Two researchers independently annotated the two validation samples.
Performance of the algorithm was determined using means of the recall and precision of the validation samples. The
algorithm was applied to the multicenter dataset to determine the actual prevalence of the contextual properties
within the modified descriptions per specialty.
Results: For the single-center dataset recall (and precision) for removal of uncertainty, uncertainty, laterality and
temporality respectively were 100 (60.0), 99.1 (89.9), 100 (97.3) and 97.6 (97.6). For the multicenter dataset for removal
of uncertainty, uncertainty, laterality and temporality it was 57.1 (88.9), 86.3 (88.9), 99.7 (93.5) and 96.8 (90.1). Within
the modified descriptions of the multicenter dataset, 1.3% contained removal of uncertainty, 9.9% uncertainty, 31.4%
laterality and 9.8% temporality.
Conclusions: We successfully developed a rule-based algorithm named UnLaTem to identify contextual properties
in Dutch modified diagnosis descriptions. UnLaTem could be extended with more trigger terms, new rules and the
recognition of term order to increase the performance even further. The algorithmâ€™s rules are available as additional
file 2. Implementing UnLaTem in Dutch hospital systems can improve precision of information retrieval and extraction
from diagnosis descriptions, which can be used for data reuse purposes such as decision support and research.
