Background: Lightweight rowers commonly utilize weight loss techniques over 24-h before competition to achieve
the qualifying weight for racing. The objective was to investigate, using a quasi-experimental design, whether
changes in weight resulting from dehydration practices are related to changes in proxies of bodily systems involved in
rowing and whether these relationships depend on the dehydration technique used.
Methods: Twelve elite male rowers performed a power test, an incremental VO2max
test, and a visuomotor battery
following: weight loss via thermal exposure, weight loss via fluid abstinence and then thermal exposure, and no
weight loss. The total percent body mass change (%BMC), %BMC attributable to thermal exposure, and %BMC attributable
to fluid abstinence were used to predict performance variables.
Results: Fluid abstinence but not thermal exposure was related to a lower total wattage produced on a incremental
VO2max
test (b = 4261.51 W/1%BMC, 95%CI = 1502.68–7020.34), lower wattages required to elicit 2 mmol/L
(b = 27.84 W/1%BMC, 95%CI = 14.69–40.99) and 4 mmol/L blood lactate (b = 20.45 W/1%BMC, 95%CI = 8.91–31.99),
and slower movement time on a visuomotor task (b = -38.06 ms/1%BMC, 95%CI = -62.09–-14.03).
Conclusions: Dehydration related weight changes are associated with reductions in some proxies of bodily systems
involved in rowing but depend on the dehydration technique used.
