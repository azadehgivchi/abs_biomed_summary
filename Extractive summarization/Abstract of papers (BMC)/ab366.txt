Background: Type 2 diabetes can negatively impact long term health outcomes, healthcare costs and quality of
life. However, intensive lifestyle interventions, including the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), can significantly
lower risk of incident type 2 diabetes among overweight adults with prediabetes. Unfortunately, the majority of
adults in the US who are at risk of developing diabetes do not engage in DPP-based lifestyle change programs.
Increased adoption of evidence-based obesity and diabetes prevention interventions, such as the DPP, may help
large employers reduce health risks and improve health outcomes among employees. In 2018, the University of
California Office of thePresident (UCOP) implemented the UC DPP Initiative, a novel, multi-component program to
address diabetes and obesity prevention across the UC system.
Methods: The goal of our study is to conduct a multifaceted evaluation of the UC DPP Initiative using the Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Our evaluation will integrate unique
and diverse UC data sources, including electronic health record (EHR) data, administrative claims, campus-based DPP
cohort data, qualitative interviews and site visits. Our primary outcome of interest is the mean percent weight change
among three groups of overweight/obese UC beneficiaries at risk for diabetes at 12-month follow-up. Secondary
outcomes include mean percent weight change at 24-month follow-up, barriers and facilitators associated with
implementatio, as well as the degree of program adoption and maintenance.
Discussion: Our study will help inform diabetes and obesity prevention efforts across the UC system. Findings from
this evaluation will also be highly applicable to universities and large employers, as well as community organizers,
healthcare organizations and insurers implementing the DPP and/or other health promotion interventions.
