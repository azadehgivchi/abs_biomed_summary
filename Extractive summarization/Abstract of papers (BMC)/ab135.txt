Background: Although the association between eating habits which can be modified and digestive diseases has
been reported, to date, no research has evaluated the association between eating habits and ulcerative colitis (UC).
Thus, we investigate the association between eating behavior and clinical outcome in Japanese patients with UC.
Methods: Eating quickly, eating until full, and skipping breakfast data was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire.
Information on clinical outcome was collected from medical records. Mucosal healing (MH) and partial MH
was defined as a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 0–1, respectively. Age, sex, BMI, current smoking, current drinking,
prednisolone use, and anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody use were selected a priori as potential confounding factors.
Results: Study subjects consisted of 294 Japanese patients with UC. Eating at speed moderate and eating quickly
were independently inversely associated with MH: the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 0.38 (95% confidence interval
[CI] 0.16–0.85) and 0.38 (95% CI 0.17–0.81) (p for trend = 0.033). Eating until full was independently inversely associated
with MH: the adjusted OR was 0.38 (95% CI 0.27–0.86). MH in patients who skipped breakfast was marginally
lower than that in patients who did not skip breakfast. No association between eating habits and clinical remission or
partial MH was found.
Conclusion: Among patients with UC, eating rate and eating until full may be independently inversely associated
with MH but not clinical remission.
