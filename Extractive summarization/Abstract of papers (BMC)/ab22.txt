Background: Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type 1 (IDDM1) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)
undergoing simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation (SPKT) are a population with difuse atherosclerosis and
elevated risk of cardio- and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of pre‑
operative screening for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), specifcally ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing, to predict periand postoperative outcomes in SPKT recipients.
Methods: Medical data (2000–2016) from all patients with IDDM and ESKD undergoing SPKT at our transplant center
were retrospectively analyzed. The correlation between PAD (defned by an abnormal ABI before SPKT and graft failure
and mortality rates as primary end points, and the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular and
peripheral vascular complications as secondary end points were investigated after adjustment for known cardiovas‑
cular risk factors.
Results: Among 101 SPKT recipients in our transplant population who underwent structured physiological arterial
studies, 17 patients (17%) were diagnosed with PAD before transplantation. PAD, as defned by a low ABI index, was
an independent and signifcant predictor of death (HR, 2.99 (95% CI 1.00–8.87), p=0.049) and pancreas graft failure
(HR, 4.3 (95% CI 1.24–14.91), p=0.022). No signifcant diferences were observed for kidney graft failure (HR 1.85 (95%
CI 0.76–4.50), p=0.178). In terms of the secondary outcomes, patients with PAD were more likely to have myocardial
infarction, stroke, limb ischemia, gangrene or amputation (HR, 2.90 (95% CI 1.19–7.04), p=0.019).
Conclusions: Pre-transplant screening for PAD and cardiovascular risk factors with non-invasive ABI testing may help
to reduce perioperative complications in high-risk patients. Future research on long-term outcomes might provide
more in depth insights in optimal treatment strategies for PAD among SPKT recipients.
