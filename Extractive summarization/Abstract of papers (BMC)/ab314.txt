Objective: We report here on the management and outcomes of neonates born to mothers with active perinatal
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Study design: In this prospective study, eligible neonates were enrolled in a database to track in-hospital
outcomes and followed up outpatient periodically till 2 months of age to assess for late onset symptoms of
infection.
Results: From April 2020 to February 2021, 67 mothers with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection and 70 at-risk neonates
were included. Two neonates (3%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 48 h of life but remained asymptomatic
during hospitalization and at all follow-up periods. Three infants were reported to have a febrile illness in 2 months
follow up period, none of which was attributable to SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusion: Our data supports the emerging evidence which describes a probable low risk of vertical transmission
of SARS-CoV-2. We also demonstrate a low risk of post-natal transmission or late-onset symptomatic infection with
SARS-CoV-2.
