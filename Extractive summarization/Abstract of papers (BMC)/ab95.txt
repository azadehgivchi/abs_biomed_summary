Background: Many parents choose support such as Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for
themselves and their children who have cancer. The aim of this paper is to describe, how parents who have
children with cancer communicated with conventional health care providers about CAM, and what types and
sources of information they would like to receive about CAM when the child was ill.
Method: This focused ethnography draws from in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted with 22 families in
Norway with 24 adult participants (two couples), including two individuals who had had cancer themselves. Four
domains were explored in the data analysis: the use of CAM, advice from laypeople about CAM, communication
with conventional health care providers about CAM, and parentsâ€™ information needs about CAM.
Results: Many of the participants had personal experiences with CAM before the child received the cancer
diagnosis. The health care providers did not raise the question about CAM in the consultations. However, when the
parents raised the question, they were mostly met in a positive way. The participants did not receive any
information about CAM at the hospital, which they would have appreciated. Instead, they received
recommendations about CAM from laypersons, which were mostly rejected, as the advice was not in line with their
health values/philosophy.
