Background: Asset-based indices are widely-used proxy measures of wealth in low and middle-income countries
(LMIC). The stability of these indices within households over time is not known.
Methods: We develop a harmonized household asset index using Principal Component Analysis for the
participants (n = 2392) of INCAP Longitudinal Study, Guatemala using data from six waves of follow-up over the
period of 1965–2018. We estimate its cross-sectional association with parental schooling (in 1967–75) and attained
schooling (in 2015–18) of cohort members. We study how patterns of cross-sectional loadings change over time
and between urban-rural settings. We assess its robustness to omission of assets or study waves and alternate
specifications of factor extraction procedure (exploratory factor analysis, multiple correspondence analysis).
Results: The harmonized index constructed using 8 assets and 11 housing characteristics explained 32.4% of the
variance. Most households increased in absolute wealth over time with median wealth (25th percentile, 75th
percentile; households) increasing from − 3.74 (− 4.42, − 3.07; 547) in 1967 to 2.08 (1.41, 2.67; 1145) in 2017–18.
Ownership of television, electricity, quality of flooring and sanitary installation explained the largest proportion of
variance. The index is positively associated with measures of schooling (maternal: r = 0.16; paternal: r = 0.10; attained:
r = 0.35, all p < 0.001). In 2015–18, house ownership versus housing characteristics and ownership of electronic
goods differentiate households in urban and rural areas respectively. The index is robust for omission of assets or
study waves, indicator categorization and factor extraction method.
Conclusion: A temporally harmonized asset index constructed from consistently administered surveys in a cohort
setting over time may allow study of associations of life-course social mobility with human capital outcomes in
LMIC contexts. The approach permits exploration of trends in household wealth of the sample over a follow-up
period against repeated cross-sectional surveys which permit the estimation of only the mean trajectory.
