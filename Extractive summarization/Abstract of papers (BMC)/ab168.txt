Background: This report describes a large international chocolate-associated Salmonella
outbreak originating from Germany.
Methods: We conducted epidemiologic investigations including a case-control study, and food
safety investigations. Salmonella (S.) Oranienburg isolates were subtyped by the use of pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Results: From 1 October 2001 through 24 March 2002, an estimated excess of 439 S. Oranienburg
notifications was registered in Germany. Simultaneously, an increase in S. Oranienburg infections
was noted in other European countries in the Enter-net surveillance network. In a multistate
matched case-control study in Germany, daily consumption of chocolate (matched odds ratio
[MOR]: 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–26.5), having shopped at a large chain of discount
grocery stores (MOR: 4.2; CI: 1.2–23.0), and consumption of chocolate purchased there (MOR:
5.0; CI: 1.1–47.0) were associated with illness. Subsequently, two brands from the same company,
one exclusively produced for that chain, tested positive for S. Oranienburg. In two other European countries and in Canada chocolate from company A was ascertained that also contained S.
Oranienburg. Isolates from humans and from chocolates had indistinguishable PFGE profiles. No
source or point of contamination was identified. Epidemiological identification of chocolate as a
vehicle of infections required two months, and was facilitated by proxy measures.
Conclusions: Despite the use of improved production technologies, the chocolate industry
continues to carry a small risk of manufacturing Salmonella-containing products. Particularly in
diffuse outbreak-settings, clear associations with surrogates of exposure should suffice to trigger
public health action. Networks such as Enter-net have become invaluable for facilitating rapid and
appropriate management of international outbreaks.
