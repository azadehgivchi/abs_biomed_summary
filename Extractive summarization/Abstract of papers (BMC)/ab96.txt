Background: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease (CD) or American trypanosomiasis, an
important public health problem in Latin America. Benznidazole (BZ), a drug available for its treatment, has limited
efficacy and significant side effects. Essential oils (EOs) have demonstrated trypanocidal activity and may constitute
a therapeutic alternative. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the EOs of clove (CEO - Syzygium aromaticum) and
ginger (GEO - Zingiber officinale), administered alone and in combination with BZ, in Swiss mice infected with T.
cruzi.
Methods: The animals were inoculated with 10,000 blood trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi II by gavage
and divided into four groups (n = 12 to 15): 1) untreated control (NT); 2) treated with BZ; 3) treated with CEO or
GEO; and 4) treated with BZ + CEO or GEO. The treatments consisted of oral administration of 100 mg/kg/day, from
the 5th day after parasite inoculation, for 20 consecutive days. All groups were submitted to fresh blood
examination (FBE), blood culture (BC), conventional PCR (cPCR) and real-time PCR (qPCR), before and after
immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide.
Results: Clove and ginger EOs, administered alone and in combination with BZ, promoted suppression of
parasitemia (p < 0.0001), except for the animals treated with CEO alone, which presented a parasitemia curve similar
to NT animals. However, there was a decrease in the BC positivity rate (p < 0.05) and parasite load (< 0.0001) in this
group. Treatment with GEO alone, on the other hand, besides promoting a decrease in the BC positivity rate (p <
0.05) and parasite load (p < 0.01), this EO also resulted in a decrease in mortality rate (p < 0.05) of treated mice.
Conclusions: Decreased parasite load, as detected by qPCR, was observed in all treatment groups (BZ, CEO, GEO
and BZ + EOs), demonstrating benefits even in the absence of parasitological cure, thus opening perspectives for
further studies.
