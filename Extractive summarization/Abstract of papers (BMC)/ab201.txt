Background: Simultaneous multislice diffusion-weighted imaging (SMS-DWI) has been used to reduce image acquisition
time. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) based on the
SMS technique in the liver and the influence of this method compared with that of conventional DWI sequences on
image quality and DKI-derived quantitative parameters.
Methods: Forty volunteers underwent SMS-DWI sequences with acceleration factors of 2 and 3 (SMS2-DWI, SMS3-
DWI) and conventional DWI (C-DWI) of the liver with three b-values (50, 800, 2000 s/mm2) in a 3T system. Qualitative
image quality parameters and quantitative measurements of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean kurtosis (MK), mean
apparent diffusivity (MD) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for the liver were compared between the three
sequences.
Results: The scan times of C-DWI, SMS2-DWI, and SMS3-DWI were 4 min 11 s, 2 min 2 s, and 1 min 34 s, respectively.
For all image quality parameters, there were no significant differences observed between C-DWI and SMS2-DWI (all
p > 0.05) in the images with b-values of 800 and 2000 s/mm2. C-DWI and SMS2-DWI exhibited better scores than
SMS3-DWI (all p < 0.01) in the images with b-values of 2000 s/mm2. In the images with b-values of 800 s/mm2, C-DWI
and SMS2-DWI exhibited better scores than SMS3-DWI for artefacts and overall image quality (all p < 0.01), and C-DWI
exhibited better scores than SMS3-DWI for the visibility of intrahepatic vessels (p < 0.001). There were no significant
differences in the sharpness of the right lobe edge (p = 0.144), conspicuity of the left lobe (p = 0.370) or visibility
of intrahepatic vessels (p = 0.109) between SMS2-DWI and SMS3-DWI. There were no significant differences in the
sharpness of the right lobe edge (p = 0.066) or conspicuity of the left lobe (p = 0.131) between C-DWI and SMS3-
DWI. For the b-value of 800 s/mm2, there were no statistically significant differences between SMS2-DWI and C-DWI
(p = 1.000) or between SMS2-DWI and SMS3-DWI (p = 0.059), whereas SMS3-DWI had a significantly lower SNR than
C-DWI (p = 0.024). For the DKI-derived parameters (MK and MD) and ADC values, there were no significant differences
between the three sequences (MK, p = 0.606; MD, p = 0.831; ADC, p = 0.264).
Conclusions: SMS-DWI with an acceleration factor of 2 is feasible for the liver, resulting in considerable reductions in
scan time while maintaining similar image quality, comparable DKI parameters and ADC values compared with those
of C-DWI.
