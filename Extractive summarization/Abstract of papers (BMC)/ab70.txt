Abstract
Background: Although the major anticancer effect of metformin involves AMPK-dependent or AMPK-independent
mTORC1 inhibition, the mechanisms of action are still not fully understood.
Methods: To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of metformin on the mTORC1 inhibition,
MTT assay, RT-PCR, and western blot analysis were performed.
Results: Metformin induced the expression of ATF4, REDD1, and Sestrin2 concomitant with its inhibition of
mTORC1 activity. Treatment with REDD1 or Sestrin2 siRNA reversed the mTORC1 inhibition induced by metformin,
indicating that REDD1 and Sestrin2 are important for the inhibition of mTORC1 triggered by metformin treatment.
Moreover, REDD1- and Sestrin2-mediated mTORC1 inhibition in response to metformin was independent of AMPK
activation. Additionally, lapatinib enhances cell sensitivity to metformin, and knockdown of REDD1 and Sestrin2
decreased cell sensitivity to metformin and lapatinib.
Conclusions: ATF4-induced REDD1 and Sestrin2 expression in response to metformin plays an important role in
mTORC1 inhibition independent of AMPK activation, and this signalling pathway could have therapeutic value.
