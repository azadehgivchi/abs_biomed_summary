Background: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies associated vasculitides (AAV) are characterized by autoimmune
small vessel inflammation. Eosinophils are multifunctional cells with both pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory
properties. Tissue activated eosinophils secrete cyto- and chemokines and form extracellular traps (EETs), they release
free granules and produce reactive oxygen species. The role of eosinophils is well established in eosinophilic
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) but very little is known about their role in granulomatosis with
polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).
Methods: The expression of surface markers CD11c, CD11b, CD16, CD35, CD62L, CD64, CD88, Siglec-8 and
CD193 and reactive oxygen species production by peripheral blood eosinophils were studied using flow
cytometry. Fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize the release of eosinophil extracellular DNA traps
(EETs). 98 GPA and MPA patients and 121 healthy controls were included in the study.
Results: Both GPA and MPA patients had decreased frequency of eosinophils in peripheral blood compared
with healthy controls (p < 0.0001), which could not solely be explained by corticosteroid treatment. The
patientâ€™s eosinophils showed increased surface expression of the Fc receptors CD16 (p < 0.0001) and CD64 (p = 0.0035)
as well as CCR3 (CD193) (p = 0.0022). Decreased expression was found of the complement receptors CD35 (p = 0.0022),
CD88 (p < 0,0001) as well as CD11c (p < 0,0001), CD11b (p = 0.0061) and Siglec-8 (p = 0,0015). Moreover, GPA and MPA
eosinophils, showed decreased capacity to produce ROS (p < 0.0001). ANCA stimulation of eosinophils from GPA and
MPA patients after C5a priming enhanced EETosis (p = 0,0088).
Conclusions: The percentage of eosinophils were decreased in peripheral blood in GPA and MPA patients and
showed altered surface marker expression and function. The enhanced EETosis after ANCA stimulation, suggests that
eosinophil can contribute to the autoantibody driven inflammatory process.
