Background: Dengue fever is a mosquito born disease associated with self-limited to life threatening illness. First
detected in Senegal in the nineteenth century, and despite its growing incidence this last decade, significant knowledge
gaps exist in our knowledge of genetic diversity of circulating strains. This study highlights the circulating
serotypes and genotypes between January 2017 and December 2018 and their spatial and temporal distribution
throughout all regions of Senegal.
Methods: We used 56 dengue virus (DENV) strains for the analysis collected from 11 sampling areas: 39 from all
regions of Senegal, and 17 isolates from Thiès, a particular area of the country. Two real time RT-qPCR systems were
used to confirm dengue infection and corresponding serotypes. For molecular characterization, CprM gene was
sequenced and submitted to phylogenetic analysis for serotypes and genotypes assignment.
Results: Three dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1–3) were detected by all used methods. DENV-3 was detected in
50% (28/56) of the isolates, followed by DENV-1 and DENV-2, each representing 25% (14/56) of the isolates. DENV-3
belongs to genotype III, DENV-1 to genotype V and DENV-2 to Cosmopolitan genotype. Serotype 3 was detected in 7
sampling locations and a co-circulation of different serotypes was observed in Thiès, Fatick and Richard-toll.
Conclusions: These results emphasize the need of continuous DENV surveillance in Senegal to detect DENV cases, to
define circulating serotypes/genotypes and to prevent the spread and the occurrence of severe cases.
