Background: Uncontrolled gout can cause significant joint and organ damage and has been associated with
impairments in quality of life and high economic cost. Gout has also been associated with other comorbid diseases,
such as chronic kidney disease. The current study explored if healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and survival
differs between patients with incident gout in the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Methods: Clalit Health Services (CHS) data were used to conduct a retrospective population-based cohort study of
incident gout between 1/1/2006–31/12/2009. Incident cases of gout were identified and stratified by CKD status
and by age group (< 55 and 55+ years). CKD status was defined as a pre-existing diagnosis of chronic kidney
disease, chronic renal failure, kidney transplantation, or dialysis at index date. Demographic and clinical characteristics,
as well as healthcare resource use, were reported.
Results: A total of 12,940 incident adult gout patients, with (n = 8286) and without (n = 4654) CKD, were followed for
55,206 person-years. Higher rates of HRU were observed for gout patients with CKD than without. Total annual hospital
admissions for patients with gout and CKD were at least 3 times higher for adults < 55 (mean = 0.51 vs 0.13) and
approximately 1.5 times higher for adults 55+ (mean = 0.46 vs 0.29) without CKD. Healthcare utilization rates from year
1 to year 5 remained similar for gout patients < 55 years irrespective of CKD status, however varied according to
healthcare utilization by CKD status for gout patients 55+ years. The 5-year all-cause mortality was higher among those
with CKD compared to those without CKD for both age groups (HR< 55 years = 1.65; 95% CI 1.01–2.71; HR55+ years = 1.50;
95% CI 1.37–1.65).
Conclusions: The current study suggests important differences exist in patient characteristics and outcomes among
patients with gout and CKD. Healthcare utilization differed between sub-populations, age and comorbidities, over the
study period and the 5-year mortality risk was higher for gout patients with CKD, regardless of age. Future work should
explore factors associated with these outcomes and barriers to gout control in order to enhance patient management
among this high-risk subgroup.
