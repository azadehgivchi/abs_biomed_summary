In recent years, the landscape of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines has rapidly expanded with the identification of
new members proven to be involved at different extent in the pathogenesis of chronic immune mediated inflammatory
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The advance of our understanding of mediators involved in the pathogenesis
of RA and in consequence, the development of novel targeted therapies is necessary to provide patients not responding
to currently available strategies with novel compounds. The aim of this review article is to provide an overview
on recently identified cytokines, emphasizing their pathogenic role and therapeutic potential in RA. A systematic
literature review was performed to retrieve articles related to every cytokine discussed in the review. In some
cases, evidence from animal models and RA patients is already consistent to move forward into drug development. In
others, conflicting observation and the paucity of data require further investigations.Forty years after the discovery of
IL-1, the landscape of cytokines is continuously expanding with increasing possibilities to develop novel therapeutic
strategies in RA.
