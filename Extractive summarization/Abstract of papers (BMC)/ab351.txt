Background: Patients with Substance use disorder have distinct personality traits, they were high score in novelty
seeking (NS) and sensation seeking and lower in Self-directedness and higher in Self-transcendence, so we aim to
investigate the relationships of temperament and characteristics with related some variables such as substance of
choice.
Design and setting: A case–control study enrolling 70 Substance use disorder patients and 70 controls was conducted
at Mashhad University of medical sciences.
Methods: Using a case–control design, a group of 70 Substance use disorder patients and 70 controls was conducted
at Mashhad university of medical sciences. All participation completed the 240 questions of Temperament
and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was employed to compare
the relationship between temperament and character traits and patterns of substance use.
Results: The scores of reward dependence, persistence, self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence
were significantly lower in the case group compared to healthy individuals (P < 0.05). In contrast, the score of novel
seeking was significantly higher in the case group (P < 0.05). On the other hand, harm avoidance was not significantly
different between the two studied groups (P = 0.637).
Conclusions: Higher NS in patients with substance use disorder is common and different traits, and temperaments
would choose different substance combinations.
