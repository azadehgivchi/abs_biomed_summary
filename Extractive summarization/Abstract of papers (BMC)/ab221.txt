Background: Statistical model building requires selection of variables for a model depending on the model’s aim. In
descriptive and explanatory models, a common recommendation often met in the literature is to include all variables
in the model which are assumed or known to be associated with the outcome independent of their identification
with data driven selection procedures. An open question is, how reliable this assumed “background knowledge” truly
is. In fact, “known” predictors might be findings from preceding studies which may also have employed inappropriate
model building strategies.
Methods: We conducted a simulation study assessing the influence of treating variables as “known predictors” in
model building when in fact this knowledge resulting from preceding studies might be insufficient. Within randomly
generated preceding study data sets, model building with variable selection was conducted. A variable was
subsequently considered as a “known” predictor if a predefined number of preceding studies identified it as relevant.
Results: Even if several preceding studies identified a variable as a “true” predictor, this classification is often false
positive. Moreover, variables not identified might still be truly predictive. This especially holds true if the preceding
studies employed inappropriate selection methods such as univariable selection.
Conclusions: The source of “background knowledge” should be evaluated with care. Knowledge generated on
preceding studies can cause misspecification.
