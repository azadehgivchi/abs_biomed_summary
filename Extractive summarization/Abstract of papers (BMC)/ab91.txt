Background: Cornin is a commonly used herb in cardiology for its cardioprotective effect. The effect of herbs on
the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450s) can induce adverse drug-drug interaction even treatment
failure. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of cornin on the activity of CYP450s, which can provide
more guidance for the clinical application of cornin.
Methods: Cornin (100 μM) was incubated with eight isoforms of CYP450s, including CYP1A2, 2A6, 3A4, 2C8, 2C9,
2C19, 2D6, and 2E1, in pooled human liver microsomes. The inhibition model and corresponding parameters were
also investigated.
Results: Cornin exerted significant inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2E1 in a dose-dependent
manner with the IC50 values of 9.20, 22.91, and 14.28 μM, respectively (p < 0.05). Cornin inhibited the activity of
CYP3A4 non-competitively with the Ki value of 4.69 μM, while the inhibition of CYP2C9 and 2E1 by cornin was
competitive with the Ki value of 11.31 and 6.54 μM, respectively. Additionally, the inhibition of CYP3A4 by cornin
was found to be time-dependent with the KI/Kinact value of 6.40/0.055 min− 1·μM− 1.
Conclusions: The inhibitory effect of cornin on the activity of CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2E1 indicated the potential drugdrug
interaction between cornin and drugs metabolized by these CYP450s, which needs further investigation and
validation.
