Background: The evaluation of treatment outcomes is important for service providers to assess if there is
improvement or not. The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA) was
developed for this use in child and adolescent mental health services. Outcome measurement in routine mental
health services is limited. This paper evaluates the psychometric properties of the self and clinician rated versions of
the HoNOSCA for routine use in child and adolescent mental health services in Kenya.
Methods: Using a prospective design, the clinician- and self-rated versions of the HoNOSCA and the Paediatric
Symptom Checklist (PSC) were administered at the Youth Centre at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi. Initial
ratings were obtained from adolescents 12-17 years (n = 201). A sample of 98 paired ratings with 2 follow-ups were
examined for measurement of change over time.
Results: Our findings showed good reliability with the self-rated version of the HoNOSCA score, correlating well
with the self-reported version of the PSC (r = .74, p < .001). Both versions correlated well at follow-up and were
sensitive to change. Using factor analysis, the maximum likelihood factoring and Promax rotation resulted in a fourfactor
structure, which with a Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy of 0.8 explained 54.74% of total
variance.
Conclusion: The HoNOSCA appears to be of value, and easy to use in routine settings. Our findings suggest further
investigation with a larger sample.
