Background: Breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging does not usually assess axillary lymph nodes -using dedicated
axillary sequence. The additional utility of dedicated axillary sequence is poorly understood. We evaluated the diagnostic
performance of dedicated axillary imaging sequence for evaluation of axillary lymph node.
Methods: In this retrospective study from January 2018 to March 2018, 750 consecutive women underwent breast MR
imaging. 263 patients were excluded, due to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 235), incomplete histopathological
information (n = 14) and follow-up loss (n = 14), 487 women were included. Two radiologists scored lymph node on
confidence level scale from 0 (definitely benign) to 4 (definitely malignant), âˆ’using standard MR and dedicated axillary
imaging sequences. Diagnostic performance parameters were compared and calculated correlation coefficient of
quantitative features (largest dimension, cortical thickness, and the ratio of cortical thickness to largest dimension of
lymph node).
Results: 68 (14.0%) were node-positive and 419 (86.0%) were node-negative. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, negative
predictive values and accuracy were respectively, 66.2, 93.3, 61.6, 94.4, and 89.5% for dedicated axillary sequence and 64.7,
94.0, 63.8, 94.3, 89.9% for standard MR sequence The dedicated axillary and standard sequences s did not exhibit
significant differences in detection of positive lymph nodes (AUC, 0.794 for standard and 0.798 for dedicated axillary
sequence, P = 0.825). The cortical thickness appeared to be the most discriminative quantitative measurement using both
axillary (AUC, 0.846) and standard sequences (AUC, 0.823), with high correlation coefficient (0.947).
Conclusion: Evaluation of axillary nodal status using standard breast MR imaging is comparable to dedicated axillary MR
imaging.
