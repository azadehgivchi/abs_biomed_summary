Background: Baclofen, a clinically available GABAB
receptor agonist, produces non-opioid analgesia in multiple models
of pain but has not been tested for effects on bladder nociception.
Methods: A series of experiments examined the effects of systemic and spinally administered baclofen on bladder
nociception in female anesthetized rats. Models of bladder nociception included those which employed neonatal
and adult bladder inflammation to produce bladder hypersensitivity.
Results: Cumulative intraperitoneal dosing (1–8 mg/kg IP) and cumulative intrathecal dosing (10–160 ng IT) of
baclofen led to dose-dependent inhibition of visceromotor responses (VMRs) to urinary bladder distension (UBD) in
all tested models. There were no differences in the magnitude of the analgesic effects of baclofen as a function of
inflammation versus no inflammation treatments. Hemodynamic (pressor) responses to UBD were similarly inhibited
by IT baclofen as well as UBD-evoked excitatory responses of spinal dorsal horn neurons. The GABAB
receptor antagonist,
CGP 35,348, antagonized the antinociceptive effects of IT baclofen on VMRs in all tested models but did not affect
the magnitude of the VMRs by itself suggesting no tonic GABAB
activity was present in this preparation. Tolerance to a
seven day continuous IT infusion of baclofen was not observed.
Conclusions: These data provide support for a clinical trial of baclofen as a non-opioid treatment of human bladder
pain.
