Background: The application of intermaxillary traction is often accompanied by the unexpected movement of
dentition, especially anchorage teeth. The aim of this study was to comprehensively compare the influence of crosssectional
shape of ribbon arch wires with edgewise and round wires on intermaxillary traction in Class II malocclusion
treatment using FEA simulation.
Methods: The dentofacial structure was simulated in finite element software. A retraction force of 1.5 N was applied
to different cross-sectional orthodontic arch wires: a ribbon wire (0.025 × 0.017-in. and 0.025 × 0.019-in.), a rectangular
wire (0.017 × 0.025-in. and 0.019 × 0.025-in.) and a round wire (Φ 0.018-in. and Φ 0.020-in.).
Results: Among the three groups, ribbon wire (0.025 × 0.017-in. and 0.025 × 0.019-in.) exhibited the lowest displacement
in the X-axis (12.61 μm and 12.77 μm, respectively) and Z-axis (8.99 μm and 9.06 μm, respectively). However,
the 0.025 × 0.017-in. ribbon wire showed the highest Y-axis displacement. In the round wire group, Φ 0.020-in. wire
displayed less rotation than Φ 0.018-in. wire, where the sagittal, frontal and occlusal rotation of Φ 0.020-in. wire was
almost half of that of Φ 0.018-in. wire. The movement of the first molar region was intermediate between the ribbon
arch group and the round wire group. Notably, the values of the 0.025 × 0.017-in. arch wire displacement, which were
higher than those of any other group, peaked at 0.019 mm in the central incisor region with a spike-like shape. The
deformation range of the Φ 0.018-in. wire group was the largest in this study.
Conclusions: The cross-section of the arch wire influenced force delivery in Class II intermaxillary traction. With the
same shape, a larger cross-sectional area led to less mandibular dentition movement. For the rectangular arch wire
and ribbon arch wire groups, since the height and width were inverted, the vertical displacement of anchorage
teeth in the ribbon wire group was reduced, but the possibility of buccal tipping in mandibular anterior teeth also
increased.
