Background: Ability to manage urges to smoke is fundamental to maximizing the chances of success in smoking
cessation. Previous studies have linked a higher dose of nicotine in nicotine replacement therapy to a higher
success rate for smoking cessation. Thus, this study was performed to compare relief of urges to smoke, up until 5 h
following treatment with a new 6 mg nicotine gum versus currently marketed 4 mg nicotine gum.
Methods: This was a randomized crossover clinical study. Following 12 h of abstinence from smoking, either one 6
mg or one 4 mg nicotine gum was given to 240 healthy adult smokers. Thereafter, urges to smoke were scored on
a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale repeatedly over 5 h.
Results: The reductions in urges to smoke over the first 1 and 3 h after administration were statistically significantly
greater with 6 mg than 4 mg gum, (p < 0.005). A 50% reduction in perceived urges to smoke was reached in 9.4
min with 6 mg gum compared to 16.2 min with 4 mg gum (median values). The median duration of a 50% or more
reduction in VAS urges to smoke score was 111 min with the 6 mg gum, versus 74 min for the 4 mg gum.
Conclusion: This study provides evidence that the 6 mg nicotine gum provided a greater reduction, faster and
longer relief of urges to smoke than the 4 mg nicotine gum.
