Background: Host genetic factors such as single nucleotide variations may play a crucial role in the onset and
progression of HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). However, the underlying genomic copy number variations
(CNVs) involved in the pathology are currently unclear.
Methods: We genotyped two cohorts with 389 HBV-related ACLF patients and 391 asymptomatic HBV carriers
(AsCs), and then carried out CNV-based global burden analysis and a genome-wide association study (GWAS).
Results: For 1874 rare CNVs, HBV-related ACLF patients exhibited a high burden of deletion segments with a size of
100–200 kb (P value = 0.04), and the related genes were significantly enriched in leukocyte transendothelial migration
pathway (P value = 4.68 × 10–3). For 352 common CNVs, GWAS predicted 17 significant association signals, and
the peak one was a duplication segment located on 1p36.13 (~ 38 Kb, P value = 1.99 × 10–4, OR = 2.66). The associated
CNVs resulted in more copy number of pro-inflammatory genes (MST1L, DEFB, and HCG4B) in HBV-related ACLF
patients than in AsC controls.
Conclusions: Our results suggested that the impact of host CNV on HBV-related ACLF may be through decreasing
natural immunity and enhancing host inflammatory response during HBV infection. The findings highlighted the
potential importance of gene dosage on excessive hepatic inflammation of this disease.
