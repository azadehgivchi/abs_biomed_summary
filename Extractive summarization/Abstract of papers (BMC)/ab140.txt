Background: Rapidly ageing populations means that many people now die in advanced age. This paper investigated
public hospital and long-term care home costs in the 12 months before death in Māori and non-Māori of advanced
age in New Zealand.
Methods: Data from an existing longitudinal study (LiLACS NZ) was used, in which 937 older New Zealanders were
enrolled in 2010. At the time of this study, 213 Māori and 241 non-Māori in the cohort had died. National Health Index
numbers were linked to the hospitalisation National Minimum Dataset to ascertain public hospitalisation and care
home costs in the last year of life.
Results: The average total publicly funded hospital and long-term care home costs in the 12 months prior to death
were $16,211 and $17,351 for Māori and non-Māori respectively. Non-Māori tended to have long lengths of stay in
their last year of life, and non-Māori men had the highest proportion with high costs and long lengths of stay in care
homes. Costs in the last year of life were 8.1 times higher in comparison to costs for individuals who did not die in the
same time period.
Conclusion: Despite New Zealand’s commitment to providing an equitable level of healthcare, this study illustrated
that ethnic and gender disparities are still apparent at the end of life. This raises questions as to whether money at the
end of life is being spent appropriately, and how it could potentially be more equitably targeted to meet the diverse
needs of older people and their families.
