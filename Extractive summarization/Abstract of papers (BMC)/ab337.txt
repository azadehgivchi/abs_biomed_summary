Background: Cardiac ventricular aneurysms affect 1 in 200,000 live births. To the best of our knowledge, no reported
cases of a left ventricular pseudoaneurym and in utero rupture exist to guide optimal management.
Case presentation: We present a case of fetal left ventricular rupture with a large pericardial effusion, cardiac
tamponade and subsequent pseudoaneurysm formation with concerns for a poor prognosis. Interventional drainage
of the pericardial effusion led to resolution of tamponade and significant improvement in fetal condition. A
multidisciplinary team was utilised to plan birth to minimise risk of pseudoaneurysmal rupture and a catastrophic bleed
at birth.
Conclusion: For similar cases we recommend consideration of birth by caesarean section, delayed cord clamping and
a prostaglandin E1 infusion, to reduce the systemic pressures on the left ventricle during transition from fetal to
neonatal circulations, until definitive surgical repair. In this case, this resulted in a successful outcome.
