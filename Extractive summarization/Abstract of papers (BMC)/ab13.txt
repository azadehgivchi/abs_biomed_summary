Background: The purpose of this research was to examine the self-reported practice patterns of Canadian general
surgeons regarding the elective repair of incisional hernias.
Methods: A mail survey was sent to all general surgeons in Canada. Data were collected regarding surgeon training,
years in practice, practice setting and management of incisional hernias. Surgeons were asked to describe their usual
surgical approach for a patient with a midline incisional hernia and a 10 Ã— 6 cm fascial defect.
Results: Of the 1876 surveys mailed out 555 (30%) were returned and 483 surgeons indicated that they perform
incisional hernia repair. The majority (62%) have been in practice > 10 years and 73% regularly repair incisional hernias.
In response to the clinical scenario of a patient with an incisional hernia, 74% indicated that they would perform an
open repair and 18% would perform a laparoscopic repair. Ninety eight percent of surgeons would use mesh, 73%
would perform primary fascial closure and 47% would perform a component separation. The most common locations
for mesh placement were intraperitoneal (46%) and retrorectus/preperitoneal (48%). The most common repair, which
was reported by 37% of surgeons, was an open operation, with mesh, with primary fascial closure and a component
separation.
Conclusions: While almost all surgeons who perform incisional hernia repairs would use permanent mesh, there was
substantial variation reported in surgical approach, mesh location, fascial closure and use of component separation
techniques. It is unclear how this variability may impact healthcare resources and patient outcomes.
