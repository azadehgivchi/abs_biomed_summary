Background: Evidence-based clinical practice is an inherent component of mental health professional practice in
developed countries. However, little is known about professional perspectives of evidence-based practice in mental
in developing countries such as Ghana. This paper describes the processes involved in the delivery of best practice
in Ghana. The paper reports on a realistic evaluation of mental health nurses and allied health professionalsâ€™ views
on the evidence-based therapeutic process in Ghana.
Methods: A purposive sample of 30 mental health professionals (MHPs) was recruited to participate in semistructured,
in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. A program theory of Context +
Mechanism = Outcome (CMO) configuration was developed from the analysis.
Results: The thematic analysis identified two contexts, mechanism and outcome configurations (themes): 1)
technical competency stimulates evidence-based mental health services, and 2) therapeutic relationship building
ensures effective interaction. The study demonstrates that contextual factors (technical competencies and
therapeutic relationship building) together with mechanisms (intentional and unintentional) help to promote
quality in mental health service provision. However, contextual factors such as a lack of sign language interpreters
yielded unintended outcomes including barriers to communication with providers for consumers with hearing
impairment and those from linguistic minority backgrounds.
Conclusion: Government stakeholders and policymakers should prioritise policies, periodic monitoring and
adequate financial incentives to support the mechanisms that promote technical competence in MHPs and the
building of therapeutic relationship.
