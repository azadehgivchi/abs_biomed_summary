Background: Randomised controlled trials, and in particular those of psychosocial interventions, often fail to recruit
to target, resulting in underpowered trials with poor generalisability of findings. The objectives of this study were to
explore the views of healthcare professionals on recruiting to psychosocial research studies, and to explore their
views on factors that may hinder or facilitate recruitment.
Methods: We conducted 14 semi-structured interviews, with healthcare professionals who had been involved in
recruitment into a randomised controlled trial of a talking therapy for depression in patients with advanced cancer.
Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis.
Results: Five primary themes were identified, comprised of 11 subthemes. Attitudes towards research were largely
positive. Health care professionals identified lack of time and narrow screening criteria as barriers to recruitment,
and also noted the tendency to withhold participants from research for reasons other than eligibility (e.g.,
gatekeeping). The engagement of the study team with the clinical recruitment site, and the frequent presence of a
researcher in clinics, were noted as facilitating recruitment.
Conclusions: Healthcare professionals involved in recruiting to trials of psychosocial interventions hold generally
positive views of psychosocial research. However, they report that constraints including space and time limit their
ability to recruit, and express anxieties about approaching patients for trial recruitment in the palliative phase of
their illness. The findings from this study can inform how best to design trials, and in particular trials of psychosocial
interventions, and train health care professionals for the study, to maximise recruitment.
