Background: Atraumatic renal pelvis rupture without pre-existing renal or ureteric pathology is an
uncommon event. It is reported in the setting of acute urinary tract obstruction, most often secondary to
ureteric calculi. Typical symptoms include acute flank pain and nausea, mimicking pyelonephritis or other
causes of acute abdomen. Spontaneous rupture occurring bilaterally without identifiable urinary tract
obstruction is exceedingly rare, and has yet to be reported in current English literature. Possible
contributing pathophysiological mechanisms can be postulated from reported cases of rupture with
observed obstruction.
Case presentation: A 58-year-old woman undergoing multiphasic computed tomography (CT) for
evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic haematuria developed on-table bilateral renal pelvis rupture seen
only after contrast administration, on the delayed phase. There was no significant past medical history of
note. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout and after the study, and was managed conservatively.
Follow-up radiographical imaging over a month showed resolution of urinoma and no further contrast
extravasation. No complications or recurrence was subsequently noted.
Conclusions: Spontaneous rupture of the renal pelvis can be a rare complication of intravenous contrast
administration even in cases without identifiable urinary tract obstruction, and it can occur bilaterally. Cases
can uncommonly be asymptomatic but typical symptoms should prompt evaluation of the kidneys,
particularly when they are not included in the initial study or no delayed phase is protocolled. Interval
imaging for resolution of urinoma and contrast extravasation is clinically relevant to monitor for and avoid
infective sequelae.
