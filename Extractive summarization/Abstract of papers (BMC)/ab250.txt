Background: Evidence indicates that inflammatory processes are involved in radicular pain as well as in resorption
of herniated disc tissue. Furthermore there are indications that the presence of vertebral end plate pathology
(Modic changes; MC) is associated with a negative effect on inflammation. It is hypothesized that in patients with
MC, the (possibly bacterial induced) inflammation will be accompanied by pro inflammatory cytokines that worsen
the outcome, and that in patients without MC, the inflammation is accompanied by cytokines that induce a
resorption process to accelerate recovery.
Methods: This prospective cohort study will include 160 lumbar and 160 cervical patients (total of 320), which are
scheduled for surgery for either a lumbar or cervical herniated disc with ages between 18 and 75. The main and
interaction effects of local bacterial infection (culture), inflammatory cells in disc material (immunohistology), MC
(MRI), and blood biomarkers indicating inflammation or infection (blood sample evaluation) will be evaluated.
Clinical parameters to be evaluated are leg pain on the 11 point NRS pain scale, Oswestry (lumbar spine) or Neck
(cervical spine) Disability Index, Global Perceived Recovery, Womac Questionnaire, and medication status, at
baseline, and after 6, 16, 26 and 52 weeks.
Discussion: Gaining insight in the aetiology of pain and discomfort in radiculopathy caused by a herniated disc
could lead to more effective management of patients. If the type of inflammatory cells shows to be of major
influence on the rate of recovery, new immunomodulating treatment strategies can be developed to decrease the
duration and intensity of symptoms. Moreover, identifying a beneficial inflammatory response in the disc through a
biomarker in blood could lead to early identification of patients whose herniations will resorb spontaneously versus
those that require surgery.
