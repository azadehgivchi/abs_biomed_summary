Background: Primary schools have long been identified as appropriate settings for improving the healthy eating
behaviours of children and helping them develop food skills. This qualitative study explored the views of Australian
primary school parents and teachers about schools’ strengths and weaknesses in promoting healthy eating and
equipping children with food skills.
Methods: Nineteen parents and 17 teachers from Victoria participated in semi-structured interviews. Audio
recordings were transcribed and underwent thematic analysis using Nvivo.
Results: This study demonstrated that parents and teachers believed that several facilitators helped promote
children’s healthy eating. These included food and nutrition education (FNE) programs, the community-based
nature of schools, and teacher role modelling and the authority schools possess over children. Time scarcity, lack of
teacher expertise, lack of leadership and funding were reported as barriers. School food environments such as
canteens, lunch orders, fundraising events and school fairs were identified as both weaknesses and strengths by
parents and teachers, which indicated inconsistent implementation of school nutrition policies across schools.
Conclusions: Australian primary schools demonstrate some useful efforts to promote healthy eating among
children. However, there are numerous facilitators and barriers which impact on the promotion of healthy eating.
These factors need to be addressed in order to develop healthy eating habits further among elementary students.
These results provide directions for policymakers and school managers, as they point to the areas that need to be
improved to assist the design of schools that better promote healthy eating among children.
