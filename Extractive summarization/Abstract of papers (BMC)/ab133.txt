Background: Zenkerâ€™s diverticulum (ZD) is an uncommon disorder due to an outpouching of tissue through the Killian
triangle that is thought to be caused by dysfunction of the cricopharyngeal muscle.
Case presentation: An 85-year-old male patient presented with odynophagia and dysphagia of initially solid food
followed by fluids that was associated with a significant weight loss over a one-year period. Barium swallow videofluoroscopy
demonstrated a posterior outpouching of proximal esophagus that was 2 cm from the epiglottis. With
the diagnosis of medium sized ZD, the patient underwent endoscopy guided diverticulotomy. Six months after the
procedure, he was asymptomatic and had gained weight.
Conclusions: Dysphagia and weight loss raises a clinical suspicion for a malignancy. Barium swallow examination is
an inexpensive method for the diagnosis of ZD.
