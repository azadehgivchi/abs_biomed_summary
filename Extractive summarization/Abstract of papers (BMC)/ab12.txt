Introduction: Uncertain nutritional outcomes following common metabolic surgical techniques are concerning
given the long-term potential for postoperative metabolic bone disease. This study aims to investigate the variations
in serum calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels following Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass (RYBP) and
Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG).
Methods: A retrospective analysis of 370 patients who underwent metabolic surgery at a single-centre group practice
in Melbourne, Australia, over 2 years.
Results: Patients underwent SG (n = 281) or RYGP (n = 89), with 75% and 87% of the cohort being female, respectively.
Postoperative mean serum calcium levels and median serum vitamin D levels improved significantly by
24 months within both cohorts. Serum PTH levels within the RYBP group were significantly higher than the SG group
across all time points. PTH levels significantly fell from 5.7 (IQR 4.2–7.4) to 5.00 (4.1–6.5) pmol/L by 24 months following
SG. However, PTH levels following RYBP remained stable at 24 months, from 6.1 (IQR 4.7–8.7) to 6.4 (4.9–8.1)
pmol/L. Furthermore, we failed to notice a significant improvement in PTH levels following RYBP among those with
higher PTH levels preoperatively.
Conclusion: Higher PTH levels following RYBP, compared to SG, may imply we are undertreating patients who are
inherently subjected to a greater degree of malabsorption and underlying nutritional deficiencies. This finding calls
for a tailored supplementation protocol, particularly for those with high preoperative PTH levels undergoing RYBP, to
prevent deficiencies.
