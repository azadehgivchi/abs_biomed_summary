Background: Nocturia is widely prevalent condition with detrimental effects on quality of life and general health. In
Malaysia, there is a lack of up-to-date prevalence study on nocturia. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of
nocturia and awareness pertaining to nocturia among Malaysian adults.
Methods: A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted among Malaysian adults aged ≥ 18 years old.
The data was collected by mixed mode self-administered questionnaire from May 2019 to September 2019. Nocturia
was defined as one or more voids at night.
Results: There were a total of 4616 respondents with 74.5% of response rate. The overall prevalence of nocturia
among Malaysian adults was found to be 57.3%. In multivariate analysis, respondents aged 31–40 (1.91 [1.52–2.40])
or > 60 years old (2.03 [1.48–2.71]), and those who presented with hypertension (2.84 [2.28–3.53]), diabetes mellitus
(1.78 [1.42–2.25]), renal disease (3.58 [1.93–6.63]) or overactive bladder (1.61 [1.10–2.35]) were associated with higher
prevalence of nocturia. A significantly lower disease prevalence (p < 0.05) was noted among those aged 41–50 (0.73
[0.59–0.91]), male (0.78 [0.69–0.88]) and Chinese (0.47 [0.30–0.74]) or Indian (0.34 [0.21–0.54]) ethnicities. A total of
37.3% of respondents with nocturia reported that they faced sleeping difficulty about half the time or more after waking
up in the middle of night. Those who had ≥ 2 voids per night experienced significantly higher mean bother score
than those who had 1 void per night (p < 0.001). Approximately half (56.7%) of all respondents were not aware that
night time urination is a medical condition. Only 25.2% of respondents with nocturia had sought medical attention
for their nocturia.
Conclusions: The prevalence of nocturia among Malaysian adults is high and strongly influenced by age, sex, race
and comorbidities. However, the general awareness pertaining to nocturia being a health issue remains low among
Malaysians. The findings also highlighted the impact of nocturia on sleep and the need for nocturia education to better
address this disease.
