The modified Delphi technique is widely used to develop consensus on group opinion within health services
research. However, digital platforms are offering researchers the capacity to undertake a real-time Delphi, which
provides novel opportunities to enhance the process. The aim of this case study is to discuss and reflect on the use
of a real-time Delphi method for researchers in emergency nursing and cognate areas of practice. A real-time
Delphi method was used to develop a national survey examining knowledge, perceptions and factors influencing
pain assessment and management practices among Australian emergency nurses. While designing and completing
this real-time Delphi study, a number of areas, emerged that demanded careful consideration and provide
guidance to future researchers.
