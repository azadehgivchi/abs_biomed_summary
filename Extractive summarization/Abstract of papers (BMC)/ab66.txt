Background: Capillary refill time (CRT) is a non-invasive technique to evaluate tissue perfusion, and quantitative
CRT (Q-CRT) adapted to pulse oximetry was developed with patients with sepsis and compared to blood lactate
and sepsis scores. In post liver transplantation, large amounts of fluid administration are necessary for maintaining
tissue perfusion to grafted liver against intravascular hypovolemia. This study aimed to evaluate whether Q-CRT can
predict poor outcomes by detecting peripheral tissue perfusion abnormality in patients with liver transplantations
who were treated with massive fluid administration.
Methods: In this single-center prospective cohort study, we enrolled adult patients with liver transplantations
between June 2018 and July 2019. Measurement of Q-CRT was conducted at intensive care units (ICU) admission
and postoperative day 1 (POD1).
Results: A total of 33 patients with liver transplantations were enrolled. Significant correlations of Q-CRT and ΔAb, a
tissue oxygen delivery parameter calculated by pulse oximetry data, at ICU admission with the postoperative
outcomes such as length of ICU and hospital stay and total amount of ascitic fluid discharge were observed.
Quantitative CRT and ΔAb at ICU admission were significantly associated with these postoperative outcomes, even
after adjusting preoperative and operative factors (MELD score and bleeding volume, respectively). However,
quantitative CRT and ΔAb at POD1 and changes from ICU admission to POD1 failed to show significant
associations.
Conclusions: Q-CRT values were significantly associated with postoperative outcomes in liver transplantation.
Although the mechanisms of this association need to be clarified further, Q-CRT may enable identification of highrisk
patients that need intensive postoperative managements.
