Background: Patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) are susceptible to joint contracture and diminished
range of motion. This is due to immobility as well as other underlying factors such as brain damage. Joint contracture
causes functional disorders thereby diminishing the quality of life of patients following the intensive care period.
Recent studies have introduced transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) as a new method for preventing
and treating joint contracture. This study was performed to determine the effect of adding TENS to stretch on the
range of ankle motion in patients hospitalized in ICUs.
Methods: Thirty-six patients admitted to the ICU ward of the hospital who were not able to move their legs voluntarily
were assigned randomly into experimental (n = 18) and control (n = 18) groups. The intervention group received TENS
along with manual stretch in the ankle three times a week for 2 weeks. The control group only received stretch in the
ankle for the same time. The extent of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of the ankle was measured using a standard
goniometer. Both groups were evaluated before and one and 2 weeks after the intervention. The obtained data were
analyzed by SPSS 21 through analysis of covariance and repeated measures ANOVA tests.
Results: In both groups, the increase in the ankle range of motion parameters was significant over time (means ranged
over 44–48 for plantar flexion and means ranged over 5–11 for dorsiflexion, P < 0.001 for all of time points). The increase
in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion in experimental group was significantly more than control group (mean between-group
differences ranged over 1.35–3.57 within 95% CI of 1.04 to 4.01, P < 0.001).
Conclusion: Adding TENS to stretch may provide more improvement in ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion.
