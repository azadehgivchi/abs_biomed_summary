Background: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are at the heart of many cellular signaling events, which
changes the function of protein. Crotonylation, one of the most important and common PTMs, plays a crucial role
in the regulation of various biological processes. However, no study has evaluated the role of lysine crotonylation
modification in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients.
Methods: Here, we comparatively evaluated the crotonylation proteome of normal controls and chronic renal
failure patients using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled with highly sensitive
immune-affinity purification.
Results: A total of 1109 lysine modification sites were identified, of which 772 sites were up-regulated and 69 sites
were down-regulated. This suggested that crotonylation modification maintains high levels in the patients with
chronic renal failure. Gene ontology(GO) enrichment analysis showed that the crotonylated proteins were
significantly enriched in the platelet alpha granule lumen, platelet degradulation, and cell adhesion molecule
binding. In addition, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-based functional enrichment analysis in the
Kyoto encyclopedia showed that crotonylated protein was enriched in CD36, which is closely linked to renal failure.
Conclusions: This is the first report of the global crotonylation proteome in chronic renal failure patients.
Crotonylation of histone and non-histone may play important roles in delaying the continuous deterioration of
renal function in patients with chronic renal failure.
