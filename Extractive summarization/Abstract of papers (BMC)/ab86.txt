Background: Atrial fbrillation (AF) may cause cerebral and systemic embolism. An increased D-dimer level indicates
hyperactivation of secondary fbrinolysis, resulting in predilection for thrombosis. To clarify the diferential efects of
anticoagulation therapy, we compared the D-dimer levels in peripheral and left atrial (LA) blood of atrial fbrillation
patients scheduled for ablation.
Methods: We analyzed 141 patients with non-valvular AF (dabigatran, n=30; apixaban, n=47; edoxaban, n=64;
mean age: 68 years, male: 60%). Peripheral venous blood and LA blood was collected before pulmonary vein isolation.
We examined the laboratory and echocardiographic parameters.
Results: After adjusting for baseline characteristics, D-dimer level in the LA was signifcantly higher in patients
treated with edoxaban than that in those on apixaban (0.77±0.05 vs. 0.60±0.05 μg/mL, P=0.047), although there
were no signifcant diferences in peripheral D-dimer levels. We classifed the D-dimer value of the LA into a normal
group (<0.9) and a high value group (≥1.0); the peripheral prothrombin fragment F1+2 level (odds ratio [OR] 1.012;
95% confdence interval [CI]: 1.003–1.022; P=0.008) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR, 0.947; 95% CI,
0.910–0.986; P=0.008) were potential predictors of high LA D-dimer levels.
Conclusions: In apixaban-treated patients, the D-dimer level in the left atrium was lower than in edoxaban-treated
patients on the day of ablation, suggesting that the anticoagulant efect of apixaban on the left atrium is better than
that of edoxaban in patients with AF.
