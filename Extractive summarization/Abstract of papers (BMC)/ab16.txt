Abstract
Background: Robotic surgery has been taken as a new modality to surpass the technical limitations of conventional
surgery. Here we aim to compare the oncologic outcomes of patients with rectal cancer receiving robotic vs. laparoscopic
surgery.
Methods: Data from patients diagnosed with rectal cancer between March 2011 and December 2018 were obtained
for outcome assessment at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. All patients were separated into two
groups: a robot group (patients receiving robotic surgery, n = 314) and a laparoscopy group (patients receiving laparoscopic
surgery, n = 220). The primary endpoint was survival outcomes. The secondary endpoints were the general
conditions of the operation, postoperative complications and pathological characteristics.
Results: The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at years 1, 3 and 5 were 96.6%, 88.7%, and
87.7% vs. 96.7%, 88.1%, and 78.4%, and 98.6%, 80.2-, and 73.5% vs. 96.2-, 87.2-, and 81.1% in the robot and laparoscopy
groups, respectively (P > 0.05). In the multivariable-adjusted analysis, robotic surgery was not an independent
prognostic factor for OS and DFS (P = 0.925 and 0.451, respectively). With respect to the general conditions of the
operation, patients in the robot group had significantly shorter operation times (163.5 ± 40.9 vs. 190.5 ± 51.9 min),
shorter times to 1st
gas passing [2(1) vs. 3(1)d] and shorter hospital stay days [7(2) vs. 8(3)d] compared to those in the
laparoscopy group (P < 0.01, respectively). After the operation, the incidence of short- and long-term complications in
the robot group was significantly lower than that in the laparoscopy group (15.9% vs. 32.3%; P < 0.001), especially for
urinary retention (1.9% vs. 7.3%; 0.6% vs. 4.1%, P < 0.05, respectively). With regard to pathological characteristics, TNM
stages II and III were more frequently observed in the robot group than in the laparoscopy group (94.3% vs. 83.2%,
P < 0.001). No significant difference were observed in lymph nodes retrieved, lymphovascular invasion and circumferential
resection margin involvement between the two groups (P > 0.05, respectively).
Conclusions: This monocentre retrospective comparative cohort study revealed short-term advantages of robotassisted
rectal cancer resection but similar survival compared to conventional laparoscopy.
