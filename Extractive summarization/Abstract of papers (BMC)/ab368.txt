Background: Waterpipe is one of the oldest methods of tobacco smoking, which has become the public health
challenge, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean countries such as Iran. This study aimed to investigate the
waterpipe smoking (WPS) in the young people of Kermanshah in 2020, using a qualitative method.
Methods: This was a qualitative study conducted with the approach of content analysis. Participants were young
waterpipe user aged 17 to 25 years selected by purposeful sampling method in Kermanshah city, located in the
west of Iran. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews in face-to-face and audio-recorded methods
based on an interview guideline during June to August 2020. Then researchers transcribed verbatim and analyzed
the content of the interviews thematically.
Results: In this study, 23 young people who were waterpipe users at the time of the study participated. The results
showed that social aspects in three sub-categories were involved in WPS including “socio-cultural aspects”, “socioenvironmental
aspects”, and “social relations”. Individual aspects of waterpipe use as second category also consisted
of two sub-categories including “motivational aspects” and “lack of psycho-protective aspects”.
Conclusions: It seems that the implementation of the policy of reducing access to waterpipe in public
environments is effective in reducing waterpipe consumption. It is suggested that educational and interventions,
based on targeted models and theories be implemented in order to increase young people’s belief and perception
on dangers of WPS, and to improve their self-efficacy to smoking cessation.
