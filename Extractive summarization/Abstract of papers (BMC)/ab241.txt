Background: Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histologic pattern of injury that characterizes a
wide spectrum of diseases. Many genetic causes have been identified in FSGS but even in families with comprehensive
testing, a significant proportion remain unexplained.
Methods: In a family with adult-onset autosomal dominant FSGS, linkage analysis was performed in 11 family members
followed by whole exome sequencing (WES) in 3 affected relatives to identify candidate genes.
Results: Pathogenic variants in known nephropathy genes were excluded. Subsequently, linkage analysis was performed
and narrowed the disease gene(s) to within 3% of the genome. WES identified 5 heterozygous rare variants,
which were sequenced in 11 relatives where DNA was available. Two of these variants, in LAMA2 and LOXL4, remained
as candidates after segregation analysis and encode extracellular matrix proteins of the glomerulus. Renal biopsies
showed classic segmental sclerosis/hyalinosis lesion on a background of mild mesangial hypercellularity. Examination
of basement membranes with electron microscopy showed regions of dense mesangial matrix in one individual and
wider glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness in two individuals compared to historic control averages.
Conclusions: Based on our findings, we postulate that the additive effect of digenic inheritance of heterozygous
variants in LAMA2 and LOXL4 leads to adult-onset FSGS. Limitations to our study includes the absence of functional
characterization to support pathogenicity. Alternatively, identification of additional FSGS cases with suspected deleterious
variants in LAMA2 and LOXL4 will provide more evidence for disease causality. Thus, our report will be of benefit
to the renal community as sequencing in renal disease becomes more widespread.
