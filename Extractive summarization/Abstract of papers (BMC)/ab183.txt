While there has been much discussion of how the scientific establishment’s culture can engender research
misconduct and scientific irreproducibility, this has been discussed much less frequently with respect to the
medical profession. Here the authors posit that a lack of self-criticism, an encouragement of novel scientific research
generated by the recruitment policies of the UK Royal Training Colleges along with insufficient training in the
sciences are core reasons as to why research misconduct and dishonesty prevail within the medical community.
Furthermore, the UK General Medical Council’s own data demonstrates a historic inattentiveness to the ease with
which doctors can engage in research misconduct. Suggestions are made as to how these issues can be
investigated and alternative incentives for career advancement are adumbrated.
