Background: To enhance the convenience and reduce the cost of prostate cancer (PC) screening, a one-step
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test was evaluated in a large population. The PSA SPOT test kit enables rapid detection
of human PSA in serum or plasma at or above a cutoff level of 4 ng/mL to aid in the diagnosis of PC.
Methods: PC screening using the PSA SPOT test was offered to male participants in educational public lectures that
we conducted in various cities. Test results were reported to participants at the end of the lectures. Blood samples
from 1429 men were evaluated. Two independent observers interpreted the tests at 15 and 30 min. The remaining
serum samples were subsequently tested using a conventional quantitative assay.
Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the test were
79.9, 93.0, 65.4, 96.6, and 91.2%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the test changed with variations in the
reading time. Quantitative assessment of the intensity of the band was correlated with the PSA value.
Conclusions: PSA testing using this kit can be easily performed. The low cost and speed of the test make it a useful
and convenient tool for primary PC screening.
