Background: Anatomical variations of the attachment of medial meniscus are a common finding. However, anomalies
of the posterior horn are extremely rare. Only two cases of posterior root anomaly have been described prior to the
routine use of arthroscopy for evaluation and treatment of meniscal pathology. In this report, we present an anomaly
of both the anterior and posterior roots of the medial meniscus that posed both a diagnostic and therapeutic
dilemma.
Case presentation: The patient is young male soccer player who is currently 16 years of age and began having the
atraumatic onset of pain and symptoms that limited performance starting at age 14 and was referred for failure of
response to nonoperative treatment. Diagnostic arthroscopy revealed the presence of an anteromedial
meniscofemoral ligament whereas the posterior root showed no bony attachment. The radiographic and arthroscopic
findings are described. The clinical decision was made after to proceed with observation, reassurance, and gradual
return to full activity with physiotherapy guidance.
Discussion and conclusion: The absence of injury, the mild complaints reported by the patient, his age, skeletal
immaturity, and remaining growth led us to adopt a conservative approach to treating this anatomic variant and
currently the patient is able to participate fully in sports without symptoms or restrictions.
