Background: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been recognised as a significant form of chronic liver disease
and a common cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in a considerable financial burden on
healthcare resources. Currently, there is no information regarding the economic burden of NASH in low- and middleincome
countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was to estimate the economic burden of NASH in Thailand as a lesson
learned for LMICs.
Methods: To estimate the healthcare costs and prevalence of NASH with significant fibrosis (fibrosis stage â‰¥ 2) in the
general Thai population, an eleven-state lifetime horizon Markov model with 1-year cycle length was performed. The
model comprised Thai population aged 18 years and older. The cohort size was based on Thailand Official Statistic
Registration Systems. The incidence of NASH, transitional probabilities, and costs-of-illness were based on previously
published literature, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The age-specific prevalence of NASH was based
on Thai NASH registry data. Costs were expressed in 2019 US Dollars ($). As we undertook analysis from the payer
perspective, only direct medical costs were included. All future costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. A series
of sensitivity analyses were performed.
Results: The estimated total number of patients with significant NASH was 2.9 million cases in 2019, based on a
NASH prevalence of 5.74%. The total lifetime cost of significant NASH was $15.2 billion ($5,147 per case), representing
approximately 3% of the 2019 GDP of Thailand. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the lifetime costs of
significant NASH varied from $11.4 billion to $18.2 billion.
Conclusions: The economic burden associated with NASH is substantial in Thailand. This prompts clinicians and
policy makers to consider strategies for NASH prevention and management.
