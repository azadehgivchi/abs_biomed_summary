Background: Treatment of congenital hemivertebra is challenging and data on long-term follow-up (≥5 years) are
lacking. This study evaluated the surgical outcomes of posterior thoracolumbar hemivertebra resection and shortsegment fusion with pedicle screw fxation for treatment of congenital scoliosis with over 5-year follow-up.
Methods: This study evaluated 27 consecutive patients with congenital scoliosis who underwent posterior thoracolumbar hemivertebra resection and short-segment fusion from January 2007 to January 2015. Segmental scoliosis,
total main scoliosis, compensatory cranial curve, compensatory caudal curve, trunk shift, shoulder balance, segmental
kyphosis, and sagittal balance were measured on radiographs. Radiographic outcomes and all intraoperative and
postoperative complications were recorded.
Results: The segmental main curve was 40.35° preoperatively, 11.94° postoperatively, and 13.24° at fnal follow-up,
with an average correction of 65.9%. The total main curve was 43.39° preoperatively, 14.13° postoperatively, and 16.06°
at fnal follow-up, with an average correction of 60.2%. The caudal and cranial compensatory curves were corrected
from 15.78° and 13.21° to 3.57° and 6.83° postoperatively and 4.38° and 7.65° at fnal follow-up, with an average correction of 69.2% and 30.3%, respectively. The segmental kyphosis was corrected from 34.30° to 15.88° postoperatively
and 15.12° at fnal follow-up, with an average correction of 61.9%. A signifcant correction (p<0.001) in segmental
scoliosis, total main curve, caudal compensatory curves and segmental kyphosis was observed from preoperative
to the fnal follow-up. The correction in the compensatory cranial curve was signifcant between preoperative and
postoperative and 2-year follow-up (p<0.001), but a statistically signifcant diference was not observed between the
preoperative and fnal follow-up (p>0.001). There were two implant migrations, two postoperative curve progressions, fve cases of proximal junctional kyphosis, and four cases of adding-on phenomena.
Conclusion: Posterior thoracolumbar hemivertebra resection after short-segment fusion with pedicle screw fxation in congenital scoliosis is a safe and efective method for treatment and can achieve rigid fxation and deformity
correction.
