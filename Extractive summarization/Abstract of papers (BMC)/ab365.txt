Background: Identification of those who are most at risk of developing specific patterns of disease across different
populations is required for directing public health policy. Here, we contrast prevalence and patterns of crossnational
disease incidence, co-occurrence and related risk factors across population samples from the U.S., Canada,
England and Ireland.
Methods: Participants (n = 62,111) were drawn from the US Health and Retirement Study (n = 10,858); the Canadian
Longitudinal Study on Ageing (n = 36,647); the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 7938) and The Irish
Longitudinal Study on Ageing (n = 6668). Self-reported lifetime prevalence of 10 medical conditions, predominant
clusters of multimorbidity and their specific risk factors were compared across countries using latent class analysis.
Results: The U.S. had significantly higher prevalence of multimorbid disease patterns and nearly all diseases when
compared to the three other countries, even after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, income, employment status,
education, alcohol consumption and smoking history. For the U.S. the most at-risk group were younger on average
compared to Canada, England and Ireland. Socioeconomic gradients for specific disease combinations were more
pronounced for the U.S., Canada and England than they were for Ireland. The rates of obesity trends over the last
50 years align with the prevalence of eight of the 10 diseases examined. While patterns of disease clusters and the
risk factors related to each of the disease clusters were similar, the probabilities of the diseases within each cluster
differed across countries.
Conclusions: This information can be used to better understand the complex nature of multimorbidity and identify
appropriate prevention and management strategies for treating multimorbidity across countries.
