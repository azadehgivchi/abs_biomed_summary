Background: Little is known about the musculoskeletal (MSK) exam providers use during the Preparticipation
Physical Examination (PPE). The primary aims of this study were to determine current practice with regards to the
MSK screening exam, if goals are being met, and if there may be opportunities for improvement.
Methods: This cross-sectional survey-based study utilized a REDCap instrument that was distributed to members of
the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM).
Questions focused on participant demographics and MSK exam practices for the PPE. Descriptive statistics were used.
Results: The study had a total of 616 participants with a response rate of 9 %. The majority of respondents (82 %) were
familiar with the 4th Edition PPE Monograph and 80% either moderately or strongly agreed that they use this as a
guideline for their MSK screening exam. The 90 s MSK screening test was implemented by 52% of the participants. The
majority of participants use an orthopedic exam as part of their PPE (82 %). Ninety-two percent of participants felt
satisfied that their MSK exam would screen for current injury, while only 42% were satisfied that it effectively screened
for future injury. 86% of participants agree that the MSK exam should be performed, while 26% said that they don’t
perform a physical exam at all.
Discussion: There is a lack of understanding of the PPE Monograph as there is wide variability in MSK screening
techniques providers use despite the majority of participants being familiar with the guidelines described in the
monograph. Additionally, providers don’t believe that the MSK exam screens for future injury.
Conclusions: The goals of the MSK portion of the 4th Edition PPE monograph are not adequately being met and
there is a need for further research to validate screening exams for the prevention of MSK injury.
