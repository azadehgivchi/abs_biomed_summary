Background: The increased availability and usage of modern medical imaging induced a strong need for automatic
medical image segmentation. Still, current image segmentation platforms do not provide the required functionalities
for plain setup of medical image segmentation pipelines. Already implemented pipelines are commonly standalone
software, optimized on a specific public data set. Therefore, this paper introduces the open-source Python library
MIScnn.
Implementation: The aim of MIScnn is to provide an intuitive API allowing fast building of medical image segmentation
pipelines including data I/O, preprocessing, data augmentation, patch-wise analysis, metrics, a library with stateof-
the-art deep learning models and model utilization like training, prediction, as well as fully automatic evaluation
(e.g. cross-validation). Similarly, high configurability and multiple open interfaces allow full pipeline customization.
Results: Running a cross-validation with MIScnn on the Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2019 data set (multiclass
semantic segmentation with 300 CT scans) resulted into a powerful predictor based on the standard 3D U-Net
model.
Conclusions: With this experiment, we could show that the MIScnn framework enables researchers to rapidly set
up a complete medical image segmentation pipeline by using just a few lines of code. The source code for MIScnn is
available in the Git repository: https ://githu b.com/frank krame r-lab/MIScn n.
