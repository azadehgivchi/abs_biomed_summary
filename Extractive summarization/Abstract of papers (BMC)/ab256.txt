Background: For acute ischaemic stroke patients, it is uncertain whether intravenous thrombolysis combined with
statins might increase the therapeutic effect. Additionally, using high-intensity statins after thrombolysis may increase
the risk of bleeding in patients. Asian stroke patients often take low-dose statins. It is speculated that reducing the
dose of statins may improve the risk of bleeding.
Methods: Data from consecutive acute ischaemic stroke patients with intravenous thrombolysis were prospectively
collected. Efficacy outcomes included NIHSS (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) score improvement at 7 days
after admission and mRS (Modified Rankin Scale) improvement at 90 days. Safety outcomes included haemorrhage
events (intracerebral haemorrhage and gastrointestinal haemorrhage) in the hospital and death events within 2 years.
Results: The study finally included 215 patients. The statin group had a higher percentage of NIHSS improvement at
7 days (p < 0.001) and a higher percentage of a favourable functional outcome (FFO, mRS < = 2) (p < 0.001) at 90 days.
The statin group had a lower percentage of intracerebral haemorrhage (p < 0.001) and gastrointestinal haemorrhage
(p = 0.003) in the hospital and a lower percentage of death events (p < 0.001) within 2 years. Logistic regression
indicated that statin use was significantly related to NIHSS improvement (OR = 4.697, p < 0.001), a lower percentage
of intracerebral haemorrhage (OR = 0.372, p = 0.049) and gastrointestinal haemorrhage (OR = 0.023, p = 0.016), and a
lower percentage of death events (OR = 0.072, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: For acute ischaemic stroke patients after intravenous thrombolysis, the use of low-dose statins was
related to NIHSS improvement at 7 days and inversely related to haemorrhage events in the hospital and death
events within 2 years, especially for moderate stroke or noncardioembolic stroke patients.
