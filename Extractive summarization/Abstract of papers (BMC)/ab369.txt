Background: This study was done as part of a larger study that aims to identify the most impactful and costeffective
strategies for the prevention and control of overweight and obesity in Kenya. Our objective was to involve
stakeholders in the identification of the strategies that would be included in our larger study. The results from the
stakeholder engagement are analyzed and reported in this paper.
Design: This was a qualitative study. A one-day stakeholder workshop that followed a deliberative dialogue process
was conducted.
Participants: A sample of stakeholders who participate in the national level policymaking process for health in
Kenya.
Outcome measure: Strategies for the prevention and control of overweight and obesity in Kenya.
Results: Out of the twenty-three stakeholders who confirmed attendance, fifteen participants attended the one-day
workshop. The stakeholders identified a total of 24 strategies for the prevention and control of overweight and
obesity in Kenya. From the ranking process carried out the top six strategies identified were: a research-based
strategy for the identification of the nutritional value of indigenous foods, implementation of health promotion
strategies that focus on the creation of healthy environments, physical activity behavior such as gym attendance,
jogging, walking, and running at the individual level, implementation of school curricula on nutrition and health
promotion, integration of physical education into the new Competency-Based Education policy, and policies that
increase use of public transport.
Conclusion: The stakeholders identified and ranked strategies for the prevention and control of overweight and
obesity in Kenya. This informs future overweight and obesity prevention research and policy in Kenya and similar
settings.
