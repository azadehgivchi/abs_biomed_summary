Background: Laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair is associated with higher recurrence rate. Mesh is used to
reduce the recurrence rate. This retrospective study is to review our experience of biological mesh fixed with suture
and medical glue in hiatal hernias repairs.
Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted for a consecutive series of patients undergoing laparoscopic
hiatal herniorrhaphy between January 2018 and January 2019. After hiatus closure, a piece of biological prosthesis
was fixed with medical glue and suture for reinforcement of the crural closure. Clinical outcomes were reviewed,
and data were collected regarding operative details, complications, symptoms, and follow-up imaging. Radiological
evidence of any size of hiatal hernia was considered to indicate a recurrence.
Results: Thirty-six patients underwent surgery uneventfully without any serious complication. There was no mortality.
The follow-up was, on average, 18.4 months, and there was no symptomatic recurrence. There was one anatomical
recurrence without any related presentation. The method of mesh fixation with medical glue and suture took 12 min
on average, and the handling was fairly easy.
Conclusions: Biological mesh fixed with suture and medical glue was safe and effective for repairing large hiatal
hernias. Of course, a longer follow-up is still needed for determining long-term outcomes.
