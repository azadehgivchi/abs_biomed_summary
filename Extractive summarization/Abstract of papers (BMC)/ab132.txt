Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions in elective and outpatient procedures. Guidance from
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provided a framework for gradual reopening of outpatient clinical
operations. As the infrastructure to restart endoscopy has been more clearly described, patient concerns regarding
viral transmission during the procedure have been identified. Moreover, the efficacy of the measures in preventing
transmission have not been clearly delineated.
Methods: We identified patients with pandemic-related procedure cancellations from 3/16/2020 to 4/20/2020.
Patients were stratified into tier groups (1â€“4) by urgency. Procedures were performed using our hospital risk mitigation
strategies to minimize transmission risk. Patients who subsequently developed symptoms or tested for COVID-19
were recorded.
Results: Among patients requiring emergent procedures, 57.14% could be scheduled at their originally intended
interval. COVID-19 concerns represented the most common rescheduling barrier. No patients who underwent postprocedure
testing were positive for COVID-19. No cases of endoscopy staff transmission were identified.
Conclusions: Non-COVID-19 related patient care during the pandemic is a challenging process that evolved with the
spread of infection, requiring dynamic monitoring and protocol optimization. We describe our successful model for
reopening endoscopy suites using a tier-based system for safe reintroduction of elective procedures while minimizing
transmission to patients and staff. Important barriers included financial and transmission concerns that need to be
addressed to enable the return to pre-pandemic utilization of elective endoscopic procedures.
