Background: The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of self-reported musculoskeletal disorders (MSD)
among Polish territorial army soldiers during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate whether there was a
relationship between occupational physical activity (OPA), leisure time physical activity (LTPA), and MSD.
Methods: The study used a cross-sectional design with a sample of 373 territorial army soldiers ages 18â€“55 who
had not previously suffered from COVID-19 and were not convalescents. The symptoms prevalence data was
collected using the standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. OPA and LTPA data was collected using the
Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall (SDPAR).
Results: The OPA, LTPA, and total physical activity (PA) among the studied soldiers was very diverse and the mean
level of PA was relatively high. A total of 56 and 40% of territorial army soldiers had experienced pain or other
discomfort in one or more of nine body regions during the past 12 months and during the past 7 days,
respectively. The most common MSD among Polish territorial army soldiers were low back pain, followed by pain in
the neck and knees.
Conclusions: The study revealed that the OPA of the studied soldiers, especially vigorous-intensity and high
vigorous-intensity OPA, was associated with a higher prevalence of MSD in several regions of the body, i.e. the
lower back, elbows, wrists or hands, hips or thighs, and ankles or feet. Along with the increase in energy
expenditure on total PA, a greater percentage of respondents experienced low back pain. Vigorous and high
vigorous-intensity PA may contribute to the occurrence of MSD.
