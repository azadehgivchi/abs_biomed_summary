Background: Type I endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological tumour in developed countries and
its incidence is increasing also because of population aging. The aim of this work is to test the feasibility and safety
of anastrozole as palliative treatment of endometrial cancer in elderly women ineligible for standard surgical
treatment.
Methods: Patients with histological diagnosis of type I endometrial cancer not suitable for surgical treatment were
enrolled in this pilot study. Anastrozole was administered 1 mg daily orally after performing an accurate clinical and
radiological staging. Validated questionnaire and self-reported outcomes were used to evaluate quality of life and
compliance during the study period.
Results: Eight patients with a mean age of 85 (range 80–88 years) were enrolled. All patients had endometrial
cancer confined to the uterus, and none progression of disease was observed during the study period. A partial
response to the therapy was reported in seven patients, while one patient had stable disease. Tumour symptoms
improvement such as pain, vaginal bleeding and vaginal discomfort was reported. The endometrial thickness after
twelve months has showed a reduction of 9.25 ± 4.77 mm. The average follow-up time was 18.25 months. Four
women died for non oncological reasons, none death related to endometrial cancer was reported. Evaluation of
symptoms showed a significant reduction of appetite loss and insomnia, while a significant increase of global
health status and fatigue was reported.
Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggested that the palliative use of anastrozole may be a suitable therapy for
the proper management of early stages endometrial cancer in elderly women not suitable for surgical treatment
with good compliance and tolerance.
