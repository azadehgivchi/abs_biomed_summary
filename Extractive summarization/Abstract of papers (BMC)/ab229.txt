Background: Identifying how unwarranted variations in healthcare delivery arise is challenging. Experimental
vignette studies can help, by isolating and manipulating potential drivers of differences in care. There is a lack of
methodological and practical guidance on how to design and conduct these studies robustly. The aim of this study
was to locate, methodologically assess, and synthesise the contribution of experimental vignette studies to the
identification of drivers of unwarranted variations in healthcare delivery.
Methods: We used a scoping review approach. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and CINAHL
databases (2007â€“2019) using terms relating to vignettes and variations in healthcare. We screened title/abstracts
and full text to identify studies using experimental vignettes to examine drivers of variations in healthcare delivery.
Included papers were assessed against a methodological framework synthesised from vignette study design
recommendations within and beyond healthcare.
Results: We located 21 eligible studies. Study participants were almost exclusively clinicians (18/21). Vignettes were
delivered via text (n = 6), pictures (n = 6), video (n = 6) or interactively, using face-to-face, telephone or online
simulated consultations (n = 3). Few studies evaluated the credibility of vignettes, and many had flaws in their
wider study design. Ten were of good methodological quality. Studies contributed to understanding variations in
care, most commonly by testing hypotheses that could not be examined directly using real patients.
Conclusions: Experimental vignette studies can be an important methodological tool for identifying how
unwarranted variations in care can arise. Flaws in study design or conduct can limit their credibility or produce
biased results. Their full potential has yet to be realised.
