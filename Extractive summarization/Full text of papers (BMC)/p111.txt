With an estimated annual incidence of 1.7 per million [1],
Cushing’s disease is rare. Untreated, it poses serious complications
including osteoporosis, hypertension, dyslipidaemia,
insulin resistance, and hypercoagulability [2] and is associated
with a 4.8 fold increase in mortality rate [3–5]. Patients
who are in remission from CD have a mortality rate which
decreases towards (although not reaching) that of the general
population [6]. Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery
(ETSS) offers patients potential remission from Cushing’s
disease, although long term surveillance is required as recurrence
rates range from 5 to 22%% [7–12].
Since the first report in 1997 [13], the selective removal
of an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary
adenoma by endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery
has gained popularity as the first line treatment for Cushing’s
disease. The primary goal of ETSS treatment in
Cushing’s disease is to produce disease remission and to
provide long-term control, while minimising complications.
Remission rates are dependent on tumour size, preoperative
MRI, cavernous sinus invasion, intraoperative
visualisation of the tumour and pre- and postoperative
ACTH and cortisol concentration [11]. Several studies
also report pituitary neurosurgeon experience as a major
factor for operative success [2, 14, 15].
Reported remission and recurrence rates after TSS for
CD vary widely according to the criteria utilised to define
remission [11], and in some studies due to limited
patient numbers or short follow-up periods. Indeed,
there is no clear consensus on how best to define postoperative
remission; an early morning serum cortisol
concentration < 138 nmol/L (5μg/dl) within 7 days of
TSS is quoted in the 2015 Endocrine Society Clinical
Practice Guideline as indicative of remission [16]. A
more strict day 3 cut-off of 50 nmol/L (1.8 μg/dl) has
been reported in paediatric studies [17], and also included
in the Endocrine Society Guideline [16]; the literature
suggests this cut-off is associated with remission,
and a low recurrence rate of approximately 10% at 10
years [14]. The main objective of this study was to assess
the outcomes of endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery for
Cushing’s disease in a tertiary pituitary centre; remission
using two widely accepted criteria [16], recurrence and
postoperative complications.
Methods
Study design
This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectivelymaintained
database of patients operated on by a single
neurosurgeon (MJ), via image-guided endoscopic transsphenoidal
approach for Cushing’s disease. Patient data
was gathered over 8 years (January 2012 to February
2020) and identified from the institution’s prospective
database. Clinical and biochemical data during the
follow-up period was reviewed. Approval was granted by
the Hospital Audit Committee.
Study population
Patients were screened for Cushing’s syndrome by the
presence of typical clinical features, together with failure
to adequately suppress cortisol to < 50 nmol/L following
overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ONDST)
and/or elevated late night salivary cortisol (LNSF) concentration
and/or elevated 24 h urinary free cortisol
measurements. As per standard guidelines, Cushing’s
disease was diagnosed on the basis of elevated serum
ACTH measurements, along with confirmatory hormone
responses to peripheral corticotropin releasing hormone
(CRH) test and inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS).
Patients with previous TSS prior to the study period
were excluded.
Surgical procedure
A single neurosurgeon subspecialising in endoscopic pituitary
and anterior skull base surgery, M.J, carried out
all ETSS surgical procedures. The surgical technique has
been described in detail in publications by Cappabianca
et al. (1998, 1999) and Jho et al. (1997, 2000, 2001) [13,
18–21]. In summary, the procedure consists of a binostril
endoscopic transsphenoidal approach. A selective
adenomectomy was performed on patients with adenomas
noted on pre-operative MRI. In cases of negative
pre-operative MRI, exploration of the pituitary gland
was performed. To confirm the diagnosis of ACTHsecreting
adenoma or hyperplasia, all specimens removed
underwent histopathological and immunohistochemical
staining for pituitary hormones.
Postoperative assessment
Patients received empiric oral hydrocortisone on day 1
and on the morning of day 2 post-operatively, prior to
assessment of 0800 h serum cortisol on day 3. A blood
sample for serum cortisol was drawn at 0800 h on the
morning of day 3, if clinically stable, prior to administration
of hydrocortisone. The Endocrine Society Clinical
Practice Guideline define post-operative biochemical remission
as morning serum cortisol < 138 nmol/L (5μg/
dl) within 7 days postoperatively [16], ‘standard criteria’.
In our institution, we also apply a biochemical cut-off of
< 50 nmol/L (1.8 μg/dl) at day 3 postoperatively to allow
early indication of biochemical remission, ‘strict criteria’.
If serum cortisol on day 3 is 50–138 nmol/L, serial measurements
are taken daily to determine if cortisol will
fall further, and assessment for improvement/resolution
of clinical sequalae of hypercortisolaemia made (such as
improvement in blood pressure or glycaemic control),
before repeat endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery is
considered.

Transient cranial diabetes insipidus (DI) was defined
as the development of hypotonic polyuria postoperatively
requiring at least one dose of desmopressin [22],
which resolved prior to discharge. Permanent DI was
confirmed by water deprivation test according to standard
criteria [23]. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
deficiency was defined by low fT4 with either low or inappropriately
normal TSH. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency
was confirmed using either Insulin Tolerance
Test or Glucagon Stimulation Test [24]. Gonadotrophin
deficiency was defined in premenopausal women as
amenorrhoea with inappropriately low FSH and LH concentration,
and in postmenopausal patients as inappropriately
low FSH and LH concentration.
Recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was
assessed by short synacthen (250 μg) test or insulin tolerance
test 3 months post-operatively, and every 3–6
months thereafter in cases of initial fail or borderline result.
Patients were assessed annually for recurrence of
Cushing’s disease, recurrence was defined by failure to
suppress cortisol to < 50 nmol/L following an 1 mg overnight
dexamethasone suppression test, an elevated late
night salivary cortisol (LNSF) or urinary free cortisol
(UFC) in patients no longer taking hydrocortisone.
Laboratory analysis
Prior to 2019, serum cortisol was measured using a
chemiluminescent immunoassay with the Beckman
Coulter UniCel Dxl 800. Intra-assay CV for serum cortisol
was 8.3, 5 and 4.6% at concentrations of 76, 438 and
865 nmol/L, respectively. From January 2019 onwards,
serum cortisol was measured using Elecsys® Cortisol II
assay on the Roche Cobas e801; intra-assay precision for
serum cortisol was 1.2, 1.1 and 1.6% at concentrations of
31.8, 273 and 788 nmol/L, respectively.
Statistics
Data are expressed as median (range) and number (%).
The Fishers Exact test was used to compare categorical
variables between groups. All p-values were considered
statistically significant at a level < 0.05. Statistical analysis
was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 statistical software
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA).
Results
Demographics
Forty-three endoscopic transsphenoidal procedures were
performed in 39 patients. Demographics are summarised
in Table 1. Median (range) age was 37 years (8–75), 30
were female. Median (range) duration of symptoms was
24 months (6–144), 72% (28/39) had hypertension, and
28% (11/39) had type 2 diabetes.
Preoperative imaging and IPSS
Pre-operative MRI localised an adenoma in 22 (56%) patients;
18 microadenoma and 4 macroadenoma (2 with cavernous
sinus invasion). No adenoma was identified in 17
patients (44%). IPSS was carried out in 33 (85%) patients.
Postoperative remission
Post-operative outcomes are summarised in Table 1 and
Fig. 1. Using standard criteria (0800 h serum cortisol <
138 nmol/l within 7 days of operation and improvement
in clinical features of hypercortisolism), postoperative remission
rates for initial surgery were 87% (34/39) for the
entire group and 89% (31/35) when patients with macroadenomas
were excluded, Fig. 1. Three patients had an
early repeat ETSS for persistent disease; day 3 serum
cortisol ranged from 306 to 555 nmol/L and interval to
repeat ETSS from 10 days–3 months. When the outcome
of early repeat ETSS was factored in, overall remission
rate was 92% (36/39) overall, and 94% (33/35) when
patients with macroadenomas were excluded.
Using strict criteria of early remission (day 3 serum cortisol
concentration < 50 nmol/L), postoperative remission
rates were 58% (22/38) overall, and 62% (21/34) excluding
macroadenomas. Including the three patients with early
repeat ETSS, remission rate was 61% (23/38) overall, and
65% excluding macroadenomas (22/34). Day 3 cortisol
was not measured in one patient due to intercurrent illness
requiring treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids.
Eleven patients (28%) had a cortisol measurement between
50 and 138 nmol/L on day 3, seven of whom had received
metyrapone therapy prior to ETSS. Six patients had serial
measurements of 0800 h cortisol up to a maximum followup
of 14 days post-op, serum cortisol concentration fell after
day 3 in all six patients. Ten (91%) were glucocorticoiddependent
at 3 months based on synacthen/ITT; 0800 h cortisol
had fallen to < 50 nmol/L in six patients.
Predictors of remission
No statistical difference was found in the rates of remission
in those patients with or without tumour target on
preoperative MRI, using either strict criteria for remission
(12/21 target vs 10/17 no target, p > 0.99) or standard
criteria (19/22 target vs 15/17 no target, p > 0.99).
Similar results were found when the four patients with
macroadenoma were excluded.
Persistent disease
Five patients (13%) had persistent hypercortisolaemia after
the initial endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (Table 2).
Three patients underwent a repeat early endoscopic transsphenoidal
surgery, Fig. 1. Remission rate after repeat
early ETSS was 67% (2/3) using standard criteria, and 33%
(1/3), using the strict criteria. Of the patients with persistent
disease following repeat ETSS, one received radiosurgery,
while the other has been commenced on medical
therapy, with a view to refer for radiotherapy.
Postoperative complications
The rate of transient diabetes insipidus after first ETSS
was 33% (13/39), while permanent diabetes insipidus occurred
in 23% (9/39). Postoperatively, there were five
cases of new thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency
(13%) and four cases of gonadotrophin deficiency (10%)
(in pre-menopausal females). There were no cases of
postoperative CSF leak, no cases of meningitis and no
visual complications. There were no other
complications.
Recurrence
No patients were lost to follow-up. Over a median
(range) duration of follow-up of 24 (4–79) months, one
patient had recurrence of Cushing’s disease. Preoperative
MRI had shown a macroadenoma; serum cortisol
on day 3 after the initial ETSS was 71 nmol/L,
which fulfilled standard criteria for remission, but not
the more strict criteria. The patient underwent a second
ETSS 13 months later. No tumour was visible intraoperatively
so no tissue was removed, day 3 serum cortisol
concentration was 308 nmol/L and the patient was
commenced on a trial of metyrapone.
Recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
Recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis occurred
in nine patients (27%), at median 13 (3–27)
months post-operatively. There was no statistical difference
in rates of recovery of HPA axis in patients with
day 3 cortisol < 50 nmol/l, and those who only passed
standard criteria for remission (< 138 nmol/l) [7/20 (follow-
up 25 (3–59) months) versus 2/11 (follow-up 16 (3–
79) months) respectively, p = 0.43]. One patient died 5
weeks post-operatively; post-mortem revealed bilateral
haemorrhagic adrenal necrosis.
Discussion
Reported remission rates following ETSS in patients with
Cushing’s disease (CD) vary widely, predominantly due
to differences in criteria used to define remission [11].
There is no uniform consensus on the criteria used to
define ‘remission’, with institutions using a combination
of biochemical and clinical criteria; this makes comparing
surgical outcome studies challenging. The normal
corticotroph cells of the pituitary gland are suppressed
due to sustained hypercortisolaemia, therefore following
successful removal of the ACTH-secreting adenoma,
serum ACTH and cortisol concentrations should fall
postoperatively. A morning serum cortisol concentration
< 138 nmol/L (5 μg/dl) within 7 days of ETSS is usually
indicative of remission, and this biochemical cut-off
is quoted in the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice
Guideline [16], and many surgical outcome studies [8,
11, 25]. Other studies have applied a more strict serum
cortisol cut-off of < 50 nmol/L (1.8 μg/L) at day 3 postoperatively
to allow early indication of biochemical remission
[10, 11, 26–28]; the literature suggests this
cutoff is associated with remission, and a low recurrence
rate of approximately 10% at 10 years [14]. Our practice
is to apply this latter approach; if serum cortisol on day
3 is 50–138 nmol/L, serial measurements are taken daily
to determine if cortisol will fall further, and assessment
for improvement/resolution of clinical signs of hypercortisolaemia
made, before repeat endoscopic transsphenoidal
surgery is considered. It is important to ensure that
serum cortisol has reached a nadir, before further intervention
is considered.
In this single-centre single-surgeon study, we report
two very different remission rates using these two widely
accepted criteria. Our remission rate, including those patients
who had an early second ETSS, using standard
guidelines, is 92%, on par with other larger studies [7, 8,
11, 25, 29]. When patients with corticotroph macroadenomas
were excluded, the remission rate was even
higher at 94%. In comparison, when we applied the more
strict criteria of day 3 cortisol < 50 nmol/L, the remission
rate was considerably lower at 61%. This criteria is in
place in our institution so that we can safely identify patients
who have early signs of remission to facilitate discharge
on day 3 post-operatively; however reporting
these rates in isolation lead to a misleadingly low remission
rate compared to the more lenient criteria proposed
by the Endocrine Society [16].
Evidence has suggested that higher day 3 cortisol concentration
is associated with greater risk of recurrence of
CD. A recent retrospective cohort analysis of 81 ETSS
for CD by Mayberg et al. reported significantly higher
recurrence rates in patients with post-operative cortisol
nadir between 58 and 149 nmol/L (2.1–5.4 μg/dL) compared
with those with cortisol < 55 nmol/L (2 μg/dL)
(33% vs 6%, p = 0.01) [30]. Recurrence of CD was low in
our series at 3%, and occurred in a patient with a corticotroph
macroadenoma, which have been shown to be
associated with higher rates of recurrence [31]. On postoperative
assessment, serum cortisol fell between the
two criteria for remission and if remission was strictly
defined as a day 3 cortisol < 50 nmol/L, then this patient
had in fact persistent hypercortisolaemia. This case highlights
the difficulty when comparing studies reporting
ETSS outcomes in CD – the distinction between persistent
post-operative hypercortisolism and early recurrence
of CD is not always clear-cut, and is dictated by the local
protocol.
Whilst our recurrence data are encouraging in comparison
to other reports on CD recurrence, which published
rates of up to 22% [11], longer term follow-up is
necessary before recurrence rates can be accurately defined.
The criteria used to define long term recurrence
of CD also varies widely in the literature; a large systematic
review (n = 6400) by Petersenn et al. (2015) reported
decreased recurrence rates when studies used UFC with
ONDST vs. UFC only, and UFC with morning serum
cortisol vs. UFC only [11]. This highlights the requirement
for standardization of remission and recurrence
criteria, for consistency in clinical practice and in the
literature.
The post-operative surgical complication rate in our
series was very low, with no cases of CSF leak, vascular
injury or visual compromise. Other published case series
have reported incidence rates for CSF leakage and meningitis
of 0–7.2% and 0–7.9% [2, 12, 32, 33] respectively.
Postoperative meningitis is strongly associated with CSF
leakage [34]. Some studies suggest that the endoscopic
approach results in higher rates of carotid artery injury
compared with the microscopic approach, which could
be attributed to the nature of the extended lateral approach
[35]. However, in this series of 43 ETSS, we report
no cases of surgical related carotid artery injury,
similar to other studies reporting 0% serious morbidity
or mortality due to carotid artery injury [33, 36]. Finally,
postoperative visual disturbance is a major concern, as it
can be life changing for patients. Factors linked with visual
complications include tumour size, patient age and
any pre-existing visual conditions [37–39]. Visual deterioration
after TSS for Cushing’s disease has been reported
to occur in some large case series at rates of 1.9%
[32] and 0.86% [12]. There were no cases of postoperative
visual disturbance in our series.
While the surgical complication rate was low, our
endocrine complication rate was higher than that reported
in other studies, particularly the rate of DI. Transient
DI occurred in 33% of cases, and permanent DI in
23%. These relatively high rates of transient DI may be
due to the diagnostic criteria used in our protocol; we
defined transient post-operative DI as one episode of
hypotonic polyuria in the setting of normal or elevated
plasma sodium concentration, requiring at least one
dose of desmopressin. In contrast, some studies discount
any polyuria which lasts less than 2 days [10], while
others require the documentation of hypernatremia for
the diagnosis of DI [40]. These more stringent criteria
will not capture cases of mild transient DI; therefore it is
not surprising that the rates of transient DI reported in a
2018 meta-analysis were lower than that in our study,
11.3% [29]. The rates of permanent DI in our study
merits particular attention. TSS for CD has been shown
to be associated with a higher risk of post-operative DI
[41, 42]. It may be that a more aggressive surgical approach
resulted in high remission rates, but at a cost of
higher rates of DI. All patients are reviewed postoperatively
in the National Pituitary Centre, where there
is a low threshold for water deprivation testing and/or
3% saline testing. We did not routinely re-test patients
for resolution of DI after their initial water deprivation
test at 3 months, and it is possible that some cases subsequently
resolved after 3 months [41, 43]. Regardless,
the rate reported in this study is significant, and emphasises
the importance of counselling the patient about the
risk of DI long-term.
Strengths and limitations
The reporting of two remission rates based on widely accepted
criteria is a strength of this study, and allows for
direct comparison of our outcomes with other studies.
All ETSS were performed by a single pituitary surgeon;
while this removes bias from surgeon experience, the
disadvantage of this is that the sample size is relatively
low. Furthermore, because we included patients who
were recently operated on to maximise numbers for analysis
of surgical complications, the follow-up period is
relatively short. A longer follow-up is required to comment
accurately on recurrence of CD. We did not have
full ascertainment of longitudinal post-operative data including
dexamethasone suppression tests, and this has
highlighted the need for protocolised follow-up to allow
for consistency when reporting our results.
Conclusion
Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery in patients with
Cushing’s disease offers excellent remission rates and
low morbidity. Remission rates are much higher when
standard criteria [morning serum cortisol < 138 nmol/L
(5μg/dl) within 7 days postoperatively] are used compared
with day 3 cortisol < 50 nmol/l. Higher remission
rates were found for patients with microadenomas. Patients
should be counselled regarding risk of post-

operative endocrine deficiencies, in particular permanent
diabetes insipidus. Longer follow-up is required to accurately
assess recurrence rates.
