Background
The notorious group of pathogens, Enterococcus faecium,
Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp., named
“ESKAPEEc” owing to their high resistances to multiple
antimicrobial agents, have recently aroused global
concern [1, 2]. Currently, the incidence of
bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by ESKAPEEc has
increased rapidly [3], and ESKAPEEc BSI brought
about worse outcomes [3], longer hospital stays,
higher economic costs [4–6], and increased mortality
[4–6]. In addition, effective antimicrobial agents
against ESKAPEEc strains were limited due to the
growth of resistance to multiple antibiotics in these
bacterial species. Inappropriate and delayed empirical
antimicrobial agents’ treatment for patients with BSI
was connected with high risk of mortality [7–10].
Therefore, a wide understanding of the main clinical
characteristics of ESKAPEEc BSI among hospitalized
children was crucial for physicians to early recognition
and select proper empirical therapy.
To our knowledge, the existing studies have given
attention to the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance
trends of ESKAPEEc in patients with BSI [11–
13], and clinical data about ESKAPEEc BSI were
mainly available in adult populations with cancer or
solid organ transplantation [14–17]. So far, there was
no data concerning the BSI caused by ESKAPEEc in
pediatric populations. Thus, we sought to investigate
the epidemiology, clinical characteristics among hospitalized
children with ESKAPEEc BSI. Simultaneously,
we also assessed risk factors, and clinical outcomes of
them.
Methods
Study population
Hospitalized children who were diagnosed with BSI
based on a positive blood culture between 2016 and
2018 at the West China Second University Hospital of
Sichuan University and aged under 14 years old were enrolled
retrospectively after obtaining ethics approval.
The exclusion criteria were listed next (Fig. 1): (1) polymicrobial
infections;(2) diagnosed with fungal BSI; (3)
incomplete clinical data.
Data collection
This study obtained the following data from electronic
medical records, including age, gender, previous
hospitalization (within 1 month), history of surgery and/
or trauma (within 3 months), records of previous antibiotic
use (within 1 month), underlying diseases, nosocomial
infection or not, symptoms, microbiology data
(microorganisms and resistance to antimicrobial agents),
likely source of infection, blood products transfusion,
pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, invasive
operation (indwelling gastric tube, central venous catheter,
urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation), empirical
antibiotics therapy, length of hospital stay and patients’
clinical outcomes. Meanwhile, the additional laboratory
results within the first 24 h of admission were collected:
the blood routine, C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).
This study was analyzed through three parts. First, all
enrolled patients were classified into ESKAPEEc and
non-ESKAPEEc groups to ascertain the risk factors of
ESKAPEEc BSI. Second, risk factors of patients with BSI
resulting from MRD ESKAPEEc were investigated by
comparing the MRD ESKAPEEc and non-MRD ESKA
PEEc groups. Finally, the 174 patients with ESKAPEEc
BSI according to patients’ final condition at discharge
were divided into survivor and non-survivor groups to
investigate the risk factors closely connected with
mortality.
Definitions
BSI was defined as the causative bacteria isolated in the
blood cultures and clinical manifestations in accordance
with sepsis syndrome [18]. The diagnosis criteria were
determined by the definitions of National Healthcare
Safety Network and CDCP [19]. ESKAPEEc were previously
defined elsewhere [1, 2, 4, 12]. The definition of
MRD was based on the international expert proposal for
interim standard [20]. Polymicrobial infection referred to
≥2 causative organisms isolated from a single blood culture
[21]. Empirical antibiotic treatment was regarded as
being “appropriate” if the isolated causative organisms
were susceptible to ≥1 of the antimicrobial agents administered
in vitro. Otherwise, the treatment was considered
to be “inappropriate”. Overall mortality referred
to death by any cause during hospitalization. Some children
who had multiple organ failure, demanded inotropes
support or mechanical ventilation were
discharged from hospital voluntarily and gave up any
further treatment. These children were considered nonsurvivor
groups within this period.
Microbiological Methods
The blood cultures were fulfilled strictly in accordance
with the standard operating procedures. The causative
bacteria identification and antibiotic resistance testing
were conducted using the VITEK 2 (BioMérieux, Marcyl’Étoile,
France) system. The interpretation criteria of
antibiotic resistance tests was determined by the definitions
of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [22].
Statistical analysis
We reported the median (interquartile range [IQR]) for
measurement dates and analyzed them using Mann-
Whitney U test appropriately. We calculated constituent
ratios for count dates and analyzed them utilizing the χ2
test or Fisher’s exact test. Variables in the univariate
analysis that exhibited statistical differences (P-value <
0.05) were placed into the binary logistic regression analysis
to investigate factors potentially associated with
ESKAPEEc BSI, MRD-ESKAPEEc BSI and mortality. All
dates were implemented with the SPSS version 22.0. Pvalues
< 0.05 were deemed significant.
Results
Two hundred fifty-two hospitalized pediatric patients
were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed BSI Between
2016 and 2018 at the West China Second Hospital,
Sichuan University. Twenty-four patients were not included
according to the exclusion criteria (Fig. 1); Ultimately,
we identified 228 patients in this study. One
hundred seventy-four of the 228 patients (76.3%) had
ESKAPEEc BSI. Six of the 174 (3.4%) patients lacked resistance
data; 124 (73.8%) were MDR ESKAPEEc and 44
(26.2%) were non-MDR ESKAPEEc.
Microbiology
As Table 1 showed, the two leading ESKAPEEc pathogens
were Escherichia coli (26.8%,61/228), Klebsiella
pneumoniae (20.2%,46/228), followed by Enterococcus
faecium (12.7%, 29/228), Staphylococcus aureus (12.7%,
29/228), Acinetobacter baumannii (2.6%, 6/228), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (1.3%, 3/228) and Enterobacter spp.
(0). Of the 124 MDR ESKAPEEc strains, Escherichia coli
and Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for nearly 65.3%.
42 (33.9%) were ESBL-producing bacteria, including
Escherichia coli (28,22.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae
(14,11.3%). 20 (16.1%) were carbapenem nonsusceptibility
bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae
(15,12.1%), Escherichia coli (3,2.4%) and Acinetobacter
baumannii (2,1.6%). In addition, there were 1
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and 8
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Comparison of ESKAPEEc and non-ESKAPEEc BSI
The main characteristics of patients with ESKAPEEc and
non-ESKAPEEc BSI were summarized in Table 2. Less
than half of the patients were males (42.1%, 96/228) and
the median age was 4.4 (range:0.7–35.7) months. The
median age between the two groups (median month, 2.5
[0.5–12.3] vs 32.7[8.0–100.4], P < 0.001) showed statistically
significant difference. Regarding underlying disease,
a greater proportion of premature and/or low birth
weight (31.6% vs 9.3%, P = 0.001), tumor diseases (16.7%
vs 0%, P < 0.001) was presented in patients with ESKA
PEEc BSI. Compared with non-ESKAPEEc BSI, patients
with BSI caused by ESKAPEEc had increased percentages
of previous surgery and/ or trauma (13.8% vs 3.7%, P =
0.042), nosocomial infection (32.2% vs 7.4%, P < 0.001),
more source of urinary tract infection (14.9% vs 1.9%, P =
0.009), but lower rate of previous antibiotic use (25.9% vs
50.0%, P = 0.001), less source of lung infection (17.8% vs
42.6%, P < 0.001), intracranial infection (1.1% vs 16.7%,
P < 0.001) and lower levels of platelet count (median, 209
[111–323] vs 341 [168–439], P < 0.001), C-reactive protein
(median mg/dL,15.0 [3.0–85.3] vs 26.5 [10.0–116.6], p =
0.017). After applying the multivariate analysis, premature
and/or low birth weight (odds ratio [OR] = 2.981, P =
0.036), previous surgery and/or trauma (OR = 5.71, P =
0.029) and source of urinary tract infection (OR = 10.6,
P = 0.004) were independent risk factors for ESKAPEEc
BSI. Source of intracranial infection was a protective factor
for ESKAPEEc BSI (OR = 0.198, P = 0.037).
In terms of empiric antimicrobial treatment and outcomes
of all cases, we found that 50 of the 228 patients
(21.9%) were treated inappropriately: 46 (27.4%, 46/168)
were in ESKAPEEc BSI patient group and 4 (7.4%,4/54)
were in non-ESKAPEEc BSI group. Patients with ESKA
PEEc BSI had received inappropriate empiric antibiotics
treatment significantly more often (27.4% vs 7.4%, p =
0.003) (Table 2). Although no significant differences in
the MODS, septic shock, mechanical ventilation, PICU
admission and mortality between ESKAPEEc and non-
ESKAPEEc BSI groups were found (all p > 0.05). Patients
with BSI due to ESKAPEEc had longer hospital stay (median
days, 20.5[10.0–31.0] vs 14.0[8.8–23.0], p = 0.023)
compared with those with non-ESKAPEEc BSI.
Comparison of MDR ESKAPEEc and non-MDR ESKAPEEc
BSI
The 168 patients with resistance data were divided into
MDR ESKAPEEc and non-MDR ESKAPEEc BSI groups.
The differences of the main characteristics between the
2 groups were showed in Table 3. MDR ESKAPEEc patients
with BSI had more nosocomial infections (41.1%
vs 11.4%, P < 0.001) and the presence of underlying disease
(72.6% vs 43.2%, P < 0.001) was also higher, whereas
the age and sex between the 2 groups were not statistically
different. Compared with non-MDR ESKAPEEc
BSI, patients with MDR-ESKAPEEc BSI were less likely
to have a history of antibiotic use within 1 month (21.8%
vs 43.2%, P = 0.006), source of skin or soft tissue infection
(6.5% vs 27.3%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the median
level of platelet count was significantly lower in MDRESKAPEEc
group with BSI than that in non-MDR ESKA
PEEc group (median,188[100–302] vs 271[173–413], P =
0.004). In multivariate analysis, the independent risk factor
for MRD-ESKAPEEc BSI was nosocomial infection
(OR = 3.314, P = 0.037), while the skin or soft tissue infection
(OR = 0.245, P = 0.011) was a protective predictor
of MRD ESKAPEEc BSI.
Regarding empiric antimicrobial treatment and outcomes
for MRD ESKAPEEc BSI, 42 of the 124 MDRESKAPEEc
patients with BSI (33.9%) were treated inappropriately
in comparison with the 4 of the 44 non-
MDR ESKAPEEc patients with BSI (9.1%) (P = 0.002)
(Table 3). Hospital stay in MDR-ESKAPEEc BSI group
was longer than that in non-MDR ESKAPEEc BSI group
(median days, 24.0 [13.0–36.0] vs 14.5 [9.0–27.3], P =
0.006) (Table 3). Whereas, no significant differences
were ascertained in MODS, septic shock, mechanical
ventilation, PICU admission, mortality between MDR
and non-MDR ESKAPEEc BSI groups (all p > 0.05).
Predictors for mortality among hospitalized children with
ESKAPEEc BSI
A total of 174 hospitalized children with ESKAPEEc BSI
were identified in our study. The overall mortality rate
of these patients was 14.4% (25/174), and no significant
difference was ascertained regarding mortality between
MRD-ESKAPEEc and non-MRD ESKAPEEc BSI groups
(13.7% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.692) (Table 3). In the univariate
analysis (Table 4), previous surgery and/or trauma, previous
antibiotic use, neutrophil percentage, hemoglobin,
platelet count, MODS, blood products transfusion,
mechanical ventilation, PICU admission were statistically
differences between survivor and non-survivor groups
(all p < 0.05). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that
previous surgery and/or trauma (OR = 7.006, P = 0.006),
mechanical ventilation (OR = 7.997, P = 0.004) appeared
to be effective predictors for death. Previous antibiotic
use (OR = 0.132, P = 0.034), normal platelet count (OR =
0.996, P = 0.037) were protective factors for death caused
by ESKAPEEc BSI.
Discussion
Data concerning the burden of ESKAPEEc BSI in hospitalized
children was indeedy non-existent. Existing information
was mainly in adult population with definite
underly diseases. There were several findings identified
in this study: (1) 76.3% (n = 174) of BSIs among hospitalized
children were caused by ESKAPEEc (124 MDRESKAPEEc).
(2) Several risk factors for BSI due to ESKA
PEEc and associated with BSI caused by MRD ESKA
PEEc were identified. (3) The overall mortality rate in
patients with ESKAPEEc BSI was 14.4% (25/174), and no
significant difference was ascertained in mortality rate
between MRD-ESKAPEEc and non-MRD ESKAPEEc
BSI groups (13.7% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.692). (4) Several predictors
for mortality among hospitalized children with
ESKAPEEc BSI were also summarized.
In the current study, 76.3% of BSIs were caused by
ESKAPEEc, which was similar to the previous reports in
Southwest China (58.7%) [12] and Rome (61.7%) [13],
but higher than that in the US (27.2%) [11]. This discrepancy
may be associated with geographical regions
and study population. Previous studies frequently reported
MDR bacteria were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella
pneumoniae, most of which trended to be ESBLproducing
organisms [23–25]. Furthermore, an upward
trend in the proportion of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae
ESKAPEEc BSI was found [12]. Similarly, a high
rate of MRD-ESKAPEEc BSI resulting from an ESBLproducing
strain among children was also observed in
this study. One common reason in many developing
countries which may result in the high incidence of antibiotic
resistant BSI was the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.
Meanwhile, our study revealed that the most
common carbapenem non-susceptibility strains were
Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.8%,15/222), which was consistent
with data reported by CHINET (5.5%) [26], but differed
from the result from southwest China (12.8%) [12].
Studies have shown that carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae (CRKP) was relevant to high mortality [27,
28]. Yet the treatment regimens for CRKP BSI were limited
in clinic. CRKP infections have posed an extreme
antibiotic-resistant threat [28]. Thus, additional studies
should concentrate on the molecular and epidemical
mechanism of CRKP.
To our knowledge, there was no study using multivariate
analyses to investigate risk factors for ESKAPEEc
BSI. In the present study, we found that premature and/
or low birth weight, previous surgery and/or trauma and
source of urinary tract infection were independent risk
factors for ESKAPEEc BSI. Moreover, there was only
two studies among adult population focusing on the risk
factors for drug-resistant ESKAPEEc BSI in multivariate
analyses [14, 15]. Gudiol C, et al. in 2014 have found
that drug-resistant ESKAPEEc bacteremia were significantly
associated with underlying diseases, previous antibiotic
use, and source of urinary tract infection [14].
Marta B, et al. in 2013 have revealed that solid-organ
transplant patients who had previous antibiotic use and
septic shock were more likely to develop drug-resistant
ESKAPEEc bacteremia [15]. Based on the existing information,
it was likely that underlying diseases, previous
invasive operation, previous antibiotic use and source of
infection were the key factors for MRD-ESKAPEEc BSI.
We further investigated the independent risk factor for
MRD ESKAPEEc patients with BSI was nosocomial infection
(OR = 3.314, P = 0.037). This result was not in
line with those risk factors ascertained in the previous
studies [14, 15]. The discrepancies may be owing to the
diverse study population, diverse definition of MRD
[14–17], diverse inclusion criteria [14–17]. Various studies
have showed that ESKAPEEc pathogens, especially
MRD-ESKAPEEc, have emerged as the predominant opportunistic
organisms responsible for nosocomial infections
[29–31], resulting in severe infection.
Accompanying by nosocomial infection, there was urgently
need for empiric treatment to cover MRD-ESKA
PEEc pathogens among children with BSI. The association
between bacterial resistance development and previous
antibiotic use remained inconsistent. Some studies
revealed that previous antibiotic exposure (especially
carbapenem) was an independent risk factor for MRD
pathogens infection [14, 15, 28, 32]. Conversely, other
study has demonstrated no association was identified between
MRD bacterial infections and previous antibiotic
use [33], in accordance with our data. Thus, further association
between bacterial resistance development and
antibiotic use previous to infection need to be monitored
closely.
To explore the possible influence of MRD pathogens
for the outcome of patients with ESKAPEEc BSI, patients’
characteristics were systematically evaluated. The
overall mortality rate among children with ESKAPEEc
BSI was 14.4% (25/174), and no significant difference
was ascertained in mortality between MRD-ESKAPEEc
and non-MRD ESKAPEEc BSI patients (13.7% vs. 11.4%,
P = 0.692), which was in accordance with previous studies
[16, 17]. This finding reflected the fact that MRDESKAPEEc
was not a risk factor associated with worse
outcome, and although resistant strains were not easily
to cure, might be less virulent. Moreover, previous
studies have reported various predictors of poor outcome
in patients with ESKAPEEc BSI, including female
sex [16], lymphocyte counts < 300/mm3 [16], corticosteroid
therapy [14] and ß-lactam monotherapy [14], septic
shock [16, 17],ICU admission [14]. In our study, we
found that mechanical ventilation (OR = 7.997, P =
0.004) was the strongest risk factor associated with mortality.
Further, previous surgery and/or trauma and
thrombocytopenia increased the risk rates for mortality
among children with ESKAPEEc BSI. Thrombocytopenia
was a well-known indicator of serious infections development
[34, 35], which can be considered an early
screening tool for poor outcome in children with ESKA
PEEc BSI. Low platelet count resulting from bacterial infection
was recorded closely and trended to indicate impaired
production caused by bone marrow suppression
and/or increased destruction owing to endothelial cell
injury and platelet aggregation [36–38].
Though it is the first time to summarize the main
characteristics of ESKAPEEc BSI among hospitalized
children, several limitations exist. First, our study is a
single-center study representing most of the pediatric
population in the Southwest China, some findings may
not be generalizable to other settings. Second, selection
and recall bias occurred inevitably due to the retrospective
analysis and these variations may partly affect the
findings of the study.
Conclusions
The present study revealed that more than two-thirds of
BSI among hospitalized children were caused by ESKA
PEEc. It also demonstrated that previous surgery and/or
trauma, thrombocytopenia and mechanical ventilation
increased the risk rate for mortality in ESKAPEEc BSI.
The risk factors ascertained could assist physicians to
early suspect ESKAPEEc BSI and MDR ESKAPEEc BSI.
