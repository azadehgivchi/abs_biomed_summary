Introduction
Substance use disorder is the third significant perplexity
in the society of Iran after inflation and unemployment
[1]. Substance use disorder is described by a cluster of
cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms caused
by compulsive drug-seeking despite the significant
substance-related problems based on the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [2,
3].
Due to neurochemical stimulation of the continuous
loops of drug-induced, addiction stimulates the brain’s
neuronal circuits that mediate reward, motivation to
behavioral inflexibility, and disruption of self-control
and compulsive drug intake [4]. In the US, estimated
that 53.2 million people used substances in 2018. Based
on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the
abuser of Methamphetamine, Heroin, Methadone, and
sedative was 1.1 million, 808,000, 256,000, and 751,000
[5]. According to Nikfarjam et al. study, the most common
variety of substance use in Iran is opium, shire,
crystal methamphetamine, cannabis, heroin/crack, stimulants
(e.g., methamphetamine),and injecting substance
with the prevalence of 1500, 660, 590, 470, 350, 300 and
280 per 100,000 individual respectively [6]. Despite many
other countries, crack in Iran is a cocaine-free substance,
and it’s a combination of heroin, codeine, morphine, and
others [7].
Temperament and characteristic traits are suggested
by Cloninger. Temperament in childhood is consensually
defined as early appearing and constitutionally
based biological and self-regulation as exhibited in different
contexts in response to stimulation. Besides child
temperament is characterized by two core features:
First, temperament is manifest in individual observable
behaviors, and, second, temperament (contra, say, emotions)
is hypothesized to be relatively stable [8]. Individual
differences in temperament are measurable early
in the development phase, and reflect individual differences
in brain structures and overall function. They are
less subject to change. The four temperament traits Are
Harm avoidance (HA) is primarily an inhibitory inclination;
individuals high in HA are pessimistic, fearful, shy
away from novel stimuli, and are fatigable. Novelty seeking
(NS) are individuals with a curious, impulsive, spendthrift,
and. HA and NS correlate negatively but weakly, so
that they are not opposite poles of a single temperament
dimension, and are both high in many individuals with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Individuals high
in reward dependence (RD) are sentimental, make close
attachments, are highly sensitive to social cues, and are
very dependent on social acceptance. Persistence temperament
(P) are hardworking, will not easily be frustrated
as they work toward a goal, and are perfectionistic.
There are three character traits. Self-directedness (SD)
are responsible, goal-oriented, resourceful, self-accepting,
and have good habits that help their chosen directions.
cooperativeness (CO) are accepted others, are empathic
and sympathetic, help others, and are guided by explicit
pro-social values [9]. Individuals with self-transcendence
(ST) have experience self-forgetfulness and flow, identify
with groups or values beyond their existence, and are
More spiritual and less materialistic [10].
The association of personality and temperament traits
with substance use disorder has been documented [11,
12]. Comorbidity of personality disorders (PDs) and substance
use disorders (SUDs) is common in clinical practice.
Borderline PD and antisocial PD are particularly
found to be associated with SUDs. The overall prevalence
of PD ranges from 10 to 14.8% in the normal population
and from 34.8 to 73.0% in patients treated for addictions.
The prevalence of any PD is higher among patients with
drug use disorder than alcohol use disorder. The co-morbidity
with PD positively correlates with the severity of
the SUD [11]. Certain temperamental traits played a significant
role in the onset, formation, and continuation of
drug dependency [13].
In summary, a high score in novelty seeking (NS)
and sensation seeking (SS) is reported in many individuals
with cocaine, alcohol, and heroin users [14–16].
Novelty seeking (NS) is a temperamental trait that is
associated with high impulsivity exploratory behavior,
extravagance and disorderliness. It is closely related to
positive emotionality and sensation-seeking (SS). High
NS (and related constructs) are associated with a compulsive
drug-seeking behavior, SUDs and worse treatment
outcomes in patients with an alcohol use disorder.
It is hypothesized that alterations in central dopaminergic
functioning explain the association between NS and
SUDs [16]. So we are aware of a few study in to assess
the relationship between personality features Influence
one’s choice of drug [17, 18]. This study found several
robust differences in temperament and character among
substance use disorder. Our study is an attempt to replicate
these findings using the new version of Character
Inventory-Revised (TCI-R), which has 240 questions, in a
different culture [7], and different socioeconomic setting
in Iran.
Material and methods
Design
This was a case–control design in which data from
Patients with Substance use disorder control subjects
were collected in a convenience sample. All patients
with substance use disorder were chosen randomly from
patients with substance use disorder visiting Ibn-e-Sina
hospital, Mashhad, Iran, in 2016–2018 and consulted by
a psychiatrist. The control group was composed of ageunmatched
and gender-matched subjects recruited from
among individuals without substance use disorder.
Inclusion criteria were diagnosed with substance use
disorder by DSM V criteria, and exclusion criteria were
unwilling to the study and all subjects with comorbid
Axis I disorders were also excluded in this study. Comorbid
Axis I diagnosis was based on a clinical interview by
a psychiatrist and DSM V criteria. The control group was
composed of age-unmatched and gender-matched subjects
recruited from among individuals without substance
use disorder and all of them assessed by a psychiatrist.
Subject
Patients aged between 18 and 55 years with substance
use disorder were recruited.
In this study, we classified substance use disorder
patients into five categories, including 1-Methadone,
Sedative, Opium 2-Methadone, Amphetamine 3-Methadone,
Sedative, Amphetamine 4-Methadone, Opium
5-Amphetamine, opium.
Sample size
Acknowledging Moreira et al.’s study with a significance
level of 0.05 and the test power of 80% to estimate the
sample size, we considered 70 patients as a case and 70
individuals as healthy control [19].
Assessments
At first, we asked the enrolled patients to fill an information
form consist of demographic information, including
age, sex, patterns of substance use, and educational
degree levels.
Personality traits were assessed using the self-administrated
Brazilian version of TCI-R consisting of 240 selfdescriptive
true/false items, assessing four temperament
dimensions: NS (range 0–40; sign: positive; minimum
significant score: N/A); HA (range 0–35; sign: positive;
minimum significant score: N/A); RD (range 0–24;
sign: positive; minimum significant score: N/A); P (range
0–8; sign: positive; minimum significant score: N/A); SD
(range 0–44; sign: positive; minimum significant score:
N/A); and three character dimensions: C (range 0–42;
sign: positive; minimum significant score: N/A); and ST
(range 0–33; sign: positive; minimum significant score:
N/A) [20].
Statistical analysis
We used SPSS software (version 20; SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL) for the statistical analysis. A P value of less than 0.05
was considered significant.
The description of continuous and categorical variables
(nominal or ordinal) included mean, median, standard
deviation, minimum, maximum frequency, and percent.
The Homogeneity of groups in terms of demographic
variables were assessed by chi-square or t-test. The
Mann–Whitney test was used to check the differences
in TCI-R and their domains between two groups or subgroups.
Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA)
was employed to assess the relationship between temperament
and character traits and patterns of substance use.
Results
In this study, 70 men with substance use disorder and 70
healthy individuals were examined. The mean age of the
cased was 34.2 ± 7.8 years, with a range of 19 to 54 years,
while the mean age of controls was 28.7 ± 9.1 years, which
was significantly lower than cases (P < 0.0001). Moreover,
the control group consisted of 11 females (15.7%) and
59 males (84.3%), whereas the studied cases were men
(P = 0.001). The average age of onset of substance use was
19.37 ± 6.15 years. The majority of those surveyed cases
were married (64.3%), unemployed (40.0%), and undereducated,
which were significantly different from the
control group (P < 0.05) (Table 1). Besides, 40% of individuals
with substances use disorder have been taking substance
daily for more than ten years. The most commonly
used substances were opium (82.9%) and opium poppy
(71.4%). Also, 80% of patients smoked, 64.3% consumed
alcohol, and 60% used sedatives. In total, 64.3% of studied
individuals were polysubstance dependent. Twenty-five
percent of people had a history of psychological disorders,
and 20% had a past medical history.
Comparison of case and control groups in terms
of temperament and character traits
Univariate analysis
The scores of reward dependence, persistence, selfdirectedness,
cooperativeness, and self-transcendence
were significantly lower in the case group compared to
healthy individuals (P < 0.05). In contrast, the score of
novel seeking was significantly higher in the case group
(P < 0.05). On the other hand, harm avoidance was not
significantly different between the two studied groups
(P = 0.637) (Table 2).
Multiple analysis
Since sex, age, marital status, and level of education
were significantly different between groups, we
run the multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA)
to adjust the effect of these variables considering
the correlation between subscales of
TCI-R. The score of RD (F (1,126) = 14.24, P < 0.001,
η2 = 0.102), PS (F (1,126) = 6.91, P = 0. 01, η2 = 0.052),
SD (F (1, 126) = 12.83, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.092), CO (F
(1, 126) = 46.22, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.268) and ST (F (1,
126) = 11.99, P = 0.001, η2 = 0.087).
Relationship of temperament and character traits
with studied variables
Univariate analysis
Methadone, Sedative, Opium: 22 individuals (31.4%)
were substance dependent in all three methadone, sedatives,
and opium substances. Individuals with simultaneous
use of methadone, sedative, or opium had an
increase in NS scores as compared with those with no
use of these three substances (F (1,68) = 5.17, P = 0.02,
η2 = 0.071). SD scores were significantly much
lower in individuals who had Methadone, Sedative,
and Opium dependence (F (1,68) = 4.90, P = 0.03,
η2 = 0.067). HA (F (1,68) = 2.64, P = 0.108,
η2 = 0.037), RD (F (1,68) = 0.31, P = 0.58, η2 = 0.005),
PS (F (1,68) = 0.56, P = 0.45, η2 = 0.008), CO
(F (1,68) = 0.41, P = 0.53, η2 = 0.006), ST (F
(1,68) = 0.48, P = 0.49, η2 = 0.007) were not significantly
related to methadone, sedative or opium. Moreover,
the total score of TCI-R was not significantly different
between the mentioned two groups (P = 0.65) (Fig. 1).
Methadone, Amphetamine: Out of 70 studied
individuals, 28(40%) had dependence in
both methadone and amphetamine. None of
TCI-R components, NS (F (1,68) = 3.83, P = 0.06,
η2 = 0.053), HA (F (1,68) = 1.78, P = 0.18,
η2 = 0.026), RD (F (1,68) = 0.13, P = 0.72,
η2 = 0.002), PS (F (1,68) = 1.44, P = 0.23, η2 = 0.021),
SD (F (1,68) = 2.5, P = 0.12, η2 = 0.036), CO
(F (1,68) = 0.46, P = 0.49, η2 = 0.007), ST (F
(1,68) = 0.71, P = 0.43, η2 = 0.010) were significantly
associated with methadone and amphetamine dependence.
Also, the total score of TCI-R was not significantly
different between the mentioned two groups
(P = 0.179) (Fig. 1).
Methadone, Sedative, Amphetamine: Overall, 23 individuals
(32.9%) were dependent on all three substances
of methadone, sedatives, and amphetamine. The NS
score was significantly higher in those individuals who
were dependent on methadone, sedatives, and amphetamine
as opposed to others (F (1,68) = 4.84, P = 0.03,
η2 = 0.066). However, HA (F (1,68) = 0.96, P = 0.31,
η2 = 0.014), RD (F (1,68) = 0.03, P = 0.85,
η2 = 0.000), PS (F (1,68) = 1.24, P = 0.27, η2 = 0.018),
SD (F (1,68) = 1.70, P = 0.19, η2 = 0.024), CO
(F (1,68) = 0.20, P = 0.65, η2 = 0.003), ST (F
(1,68) = 1.04, P = 0.31, η2 = 0.015) were not significantly
different in those who abuse methadone, sedative or
amphetamine in comparison to others. To add more,
the total score of TCI-R was not significantly different
between the mentioned two groups (P = 0.649) (Fig. 1).
Methadone, Opium: Overall, 23 individuals
(32.9%) were dependent on all three methadone,
sedatives, and amphetamine substances. None of
TCI-R components, NS (F (1,68) = 1.16, P = 0.28,
η2 = 0.017), HA (F (1,68) = 0.71, P = 0.40,
η2 = 0.01), RD (F (1,68) = 0.25, P = 0.62, η2 = 0.004),
PS (F (1,68) = 0.86, P = 0.36, η2 = 0.012), SD
(F (1,68) = 0.45, P = 0.51, η2 = 0.007), CO (F
(1,68) = 0.009, P = 0.92, η2 = 0.000), ST (F
(1,68) = 0.89, P = 0.35, η2 = 0.013) were significantly
associated with methadone and opium dependence.
Also, the total score of TCI-R was not significantly
different between those dependent on methadone and
opium compared to others (P = 0.777) (Fig. 1).
Amphetamine, Opium: In those 32 individuals who
were amphetamine and opium dependent, sedatives
and opium. Individuals with simultaneous use of opium
and amphetamine had a decrease in SD scores compared
to others (F (1,68) = 5.19, P = 0.03, η2 = 0.071)
(Fig. 1).
Age: None of TCI-R components, except ST (F
(1,68) = 5.74, P = 0.02, η2 = 0.078), were significantly
associated with age. The older the individual, the higher
the score of self-transcendence.
Studies: In the univariate analysis, there were no statistical
differences between the individual with different
levels of education and scores of TCI-R.
Past Psychological history: According to the result of
MANCOVA, those patients with PPH had significantly
higher scores of HA (F (1,68) = 4.0, P = 0.04, η2 = 0.056)
and lower scores of ST (F (1,68) = 4.2, P = 0.03,
η2 = 0.058)
Alcohol dependence: There was no statistical association
between scores of TCI-R and alcohol dependence.
Polysubstance dependence: About 36% of the studied
individual were polysubstance dependent in whom
the scores of RD (F (1,68) = 8.9, P = 0.004, η2 = 0.116),
PS (F (1,68) = 11.04, P = 0.001, η2 = 0.140) and ST (F
(1,68) = 7.65, P = 0.007, η2 = 0.101) were significantly
lower than others (Table 3).
Multiple analysis
To assess the effect of variables simultaneously, we performed
multiple analysis of covariance considering age,
studies, opium, sedative, amphetamine, methadone
and alcohol dependence. The score of ST increased
with age (F (1,61) = 7.25, P = 0.009, η2 = 0.106). Also,
the NS scores increase significantly with a sedative (F
(1,61) = 5.28, P = 0.02, η2 = 0.080) and amphetamine (F
(1,61) = 7.59, P = 0.008, η2 = 0.111) dependence while SD
score decreased in those individuals who were sedative
dependent (F (1,61) = 5.67, P = 0.02, η2 = 0.085).
Discussion
In this case–control study comparing 70 men with substance
used disorder patients with 70 unmatched control,
the combined scores for TCI were significantly different.
Substance use disorder patients presented lower RD, PS,
SD, CO, ST, and higher NS compare to the control group.
On the other hand, the HA was not significantly different
between the two studied groups. According to many
studies, patients with substance use disorder presented
higher HA and higher NS compared to healthy individuals
[6, 13, 21–23]. However, some study assumed that NS
was even lower in patients with substance use disorder
than a control, for instance, Süleyman Can et al. study
on substance abusers in the Turkish military population
and concluded that NS and HA, and significantly lower
scores for PE, SD, and CO were detected in substance
abusers than in the controls [24].
Based on previous studies performed in Iran, including
Abolghasemi et al. and Ketabi et al. study, both HA and
NS were higher in substance disorder patients. In contrast,
in the present study, despite the higher score of HA
in the case group, the differences were statically meaningless
[25, 26] but in clinical you found that high Harm
Avoidance increases the risk of developing an addiction.
Following numerous studies, including Abolghasemi
et al. and Ketabi et al. studies, in the present study, NS
was significantly higher in the case compared to the
healthy group [25, 26].
Patients with Amphetamine plus Methadone and Sedative
use disorder showed higher NS than healthy control.
In contrast, in patients with Amphetamine plus Methadone
use disorder, TCI-R components were not significantly
different from healthy control; this result maybe
helps to aware the relationship between personality features
that Influence one’s choice of drug.
Pournaghash et al. compared the TCI score of Amphetamine
use disorder to opium used disorder and concluded
that all TCI-R components were significantly
higher in Amphetamine use disorder. In contrast, the
present study showed that patients with Opium plus
Methadone and Amphetamine plus Methadone use disorder
were the same in all TCI scores. However, in Methadone
plus Opium use disorder, SD was lower [23].
In our study, patients with a Polysubstance use disorder
presented lower RD, PS, and ST, while in Koller et al.,
studies on NS and ST were higher in Polysubstance use
disorder [27].
Controversy present in almost every research in TCI
and addiction’s field. These disagreements might exist
because of diversity in population or even substantial differences
worldwide.
In conclusion, higher novelty sicking in patients with
substance use disorder is common and different traits,
and temperaments would choose different substance
combinations.
Limitation
Our study is retrospective, that is, personality factors are
studied in individuals who are already addicted, so that
the causal direction of the findings is uncertain. Optimally
the causal hypotheses of the kind made are more
reliable if found in prospective follow-up studies. other
limitations of the study is the small sample size, In future
studies, we strongly suggested that future studies design
to investigate the effect of this method with higher sample
size and prospective follow-up studies.
