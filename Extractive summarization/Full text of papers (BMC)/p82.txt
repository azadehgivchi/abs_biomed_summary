Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac 
arrhythmia with adverse clinical outcomes and diverse 
pathophysiological background [1]. AF affects approxi-
mately 20.9 million men and 12.6 million women world-
wide, representing a 1.5-fold and two-fold increase in 
all-cause mortality, respectively [2].
Aortic stenosis is the most prevalent valvular disease, 
with aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery remaining 
the gold standard treatment for severe symptomatic aor-
tic stenosis, improving both quality of life and overall 
survival [3]. Owing to ageing demographics, aortic steno-
sis has been increasing over the past decades, presenting 
an AF prevalence of 35.6% in a multicentre prospective 
registry of aortic stenosis patients [4, 5]. However, the 
pathophysiology of AF in aortic stenosis is poorly under-
stood. AF pathophysiology begins with ectopic firing 
and re-entry, which depend on several mechanisms: (1) 
ion channel dysfunction; (2)  Ca2+-handling abnormali-
ties; (3) structural remodelling; (4) autonomic neural 
dysregulation. Regarding ion channel dysfunction, cardi-
omyocytes return to their resting potential after depolar-
ization through an equilibrium between If (pacemaker) 
and Ik1 (inward rectifier k+) currents, which might be

dysfunctional in AF. In addition, early afterdepolariza-
tions (EADs) and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), 
most likely related to  Ca2+-handling abnormalities, may 
contribute significantly to AF pathogenesis [6]. Structural 
and electrical remodelling is core to most forms of AF, 
particularly in the more permanent ones [7]. Concern-
ing structural remodelling, atrial fibrosis is key and alters 
cardiomyocyte electrical coupling due to misplacing and 
changing the structure of connexins, thus inducing frag-
mented electrical conduction [8]. Evidence suggests atrial 
remodeling is associated with disease occurrence and 
progression, which involves specific molecular markers 
of fibrosis such as Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloprotein-
ase (TIMP) 1, Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 and 
Collagen type 1 Carboxy-terminal Peptide (CICP), with 
diverse contributions according to different AF subtypes 
[1]. These biomarkers appear to increase with higher 
arrhythmia burden [1]. Increased afterload is associated 
with AF and myocardial fibrosis [5] and while TIMP-1 
has been reported to increase, MMP1 was shown to 
decrease in AF patients’ serum [9]. Conversely, atrium 
TIMP-4 in AF patients with rheumatic heart disease was 
lower when compared with Sinus Rhythm (SR) patients, 
while MMP-2, type I, and type II collagen were increased 
in the AF group [10].
This is the first study aimed to characterize atrial fibro-
sis in AF patients with aortic stenosis submitted to AVR 
surgery, as well as evaluate the gene expression profile of 
several extracellular matrix proteins and quantify differ-
entially expressed targets in the serum of AF patients.
Methods
This study aimed to evaluate atrium extracellular matrix 
remodeling in AF patients with severe aortic stenosis, 
through histological fibrosis quantification and extra-
cellular matrix gene expression analysis of an array of 
genes: collagen I and III, TIMP 1, TIMP2, TIMP4, MMP 
2, MMP9, MMP16, and TGF-β1. Serum quantification 
of target extracellular matrix proteins was performed to 
establish potential AF biomarkers (TIMP1 and TIMP2).
Study design
This study represents a posthoc analysis of a prospective 
study on a cohort of aortic stenosis patients. Between 
2014 and 2019, 56 patients with severe aortic steno-
sis submitted to AVR surgery in a tertiary hospital were 
selected. Their baseline clinical and echocardiogra-
phy data were recorded, and serum and atrium samples 
were collected. Reoperations and emergent cases were 
excluded, as well as patients with severe aortic regurgi-
tation. The recruited patients were then grouped accord-
ing to their cardiac rhythm status: AF or SR (N = 15 and 
N = 42, respectively) (see below).
The investigation conforms with the principles out-
lined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was 
approved by the institution’s ethics committee and data 
confidentiality was assured. All participants gave written 
informed consent.
Data collection
Chronic Kidney Disease was considered when baseline 
creatinine levels exceeded 1.5  mg/dL. New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) functional classification was used 
to characterize heart failure symptoms. Coronary Artery 
Disease (CAD) was considered when previous myocar-
dial infarction was reported and/or invasive coronary 
angiography reported stenosis > 50%. Cerebrovascu-
lar disease was defined based on a history of stroke or 
transitory ischemic attack or a reported stenosis > 50% 
on carotid doppler ultrasonography. Smoking was con-
sidered when patients reported being active smokers or 
past smokers within less than a year of cessation. Patients 
underwent an echocardiographic evaluation performed 
by experienced operators up to 6 months before surgery. 
Cardiac chamber dimensions and volumes were meas-
ured as recommended and systolic function was accessed 
by evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction, using 
the modified Simpson rule from biplane 4 and 2 cham-
ber views [11]. Reduced ejection fraction was considered 
below 40%, according to the European Society of Cardiol-
ogy guidelines [12] Left atrium enlargement was consid-
ered when left atrium diameter was equal or superior to 
40 mm.
As previously mentioned, patients were divided into 
SR and AF groups. All patients had an electrocardiogram 
(EKG) performed up to 6  months prior to surgery and 
AF was defined according to international guidelines as 
absolutely irregular RR intervals and no discernible, dis-
tinct P waves, with an episode lasting at least 30 s being 
the threshold for diagnostic purposes [2]. Definitions of 
paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent or per-
manent AF followed the European Society of Cardiology 
guidelines. Two patients presented with paroxysmal AF 
(13.3%), 8 with permanent AF (53.3%) and 5 with persis-
tent AF (33.3%) [2].
Biopsy and serum sample collection
During surgery, an atrium appendix myocardial biopsy 
was collected, and the sample was either immediately 
fixed in formalin (formalin solution, neutral buffered, 
10%) and processed for histological analysis or flash-
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC for pos-
terior gene expression analysis. Whole blood samples 
were collected at the same timepoint and immediately 
centrifuged at 3000  rpm for 10  min; serum was stored

at –  80  °C for further Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent 
Assay (ELISA).
Histomorphometric quantification
All samples were processed using Leica Histocore Pearl 
automatic processor. A total of 29 (SR N = 19, AF N = 10) 
and 18 patients (SR N = 13, AF = 5) were used to assess 
fibrosis and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, respec-
tively. Paraffin inclusion was performed in Leica His-
tocore Arcardia Embedding System. Sections of 3  µm 
were cut and stained with hematoxylin–eosin (Harris 
hematoxylin and alcoholic eosin) for assessing cardio-
myocyte cross-sectional area using Leitz Wetzlar-Dialux 
20 microscopy and coupled camera (Olympus XC30). 
At least 60 cardiomyocytes were counted using the 
250 × amplification; fibrosis was assessed using 3  µm 
atrial sections stained with Red Sirius and quantification 
was performed with Image-Pro Plus in 8 fields per sam-
ple using the 100 × amplification (results presented as 
percentage of the total area of each section).
Gene expression analysis
A total of 19 patients (SR N = 11, AF N = 8) were eval-
uated for the gene expression of several extracellu-
lar matrix proteins: collagen I and III, TIMP1, TIMP2, 
TIMP4, MMP2, MMP9, MMP16 and Transforming 
Growth Factor β1 (TGF-β1). RNA extraction was per-
formed using a TRIzol protocol following the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Briefly, tissue cells were disrupted 
in TRIizol reagent using 1.4  mm beads (Minilys, Ber-
tin). After adding chloroform and centrifugation at 
14,000 rpm, at 4 °C, for 15 min, RNA was extracted and 
precipitated in isopropanol. RNA was washed in 70% 
ethanol and resuspended in Tris 10 mM. RNA concen-
tration and integrity were assessed both in the Nan-
odrop and by electrophoresis. cDNA (100  ng/µL) was 
synthesized using the SensiFAST™ cDNA Synthesis Kit 
(Bioline). Reactions were performed in a Bio-Rad T100 
thermal cycler using the following protocol: 10  min of 
primer annealing at 25 °C followed by reverse transcrip-
tion for 15 min at 42 °C, followed by 5 min at 85 °C to 
inactivate reverse transcriptase. Quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (qPCR) reactions were run in triplicate in 
10 µL containing the following: 1 µL sample cDNA, 5 µL 
2 × SensiFAST™ SYBR Hi-ROX Mix (Bioline), and 0.4 µL 
primers. RT-qPCR reactions were performed using the 
PikoReal™ Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Scientific™) 
using the following protocol: polymerase was activated 
for 3 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of denaturation 
for 15 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and exten-
sion for 30 s at 72 °C. Thereafter, melting curve analysis 
from 65 to 95  °C in 0,5  °C increments was performed. 
Prior to gene expression quantification using the  2−ΔCT 
method, PCR efficiency of each gene including the inter-
nal control gene (18s RNA) was determined and it was 
assured that they were identical. Primer sequences are 
presented in Table 1.
Target gene expression was normalized to the 18S gene. 
Initial mRNA expression data were logarithm trans-
formed using the  2−ΔC
T method [13].
Serum quantification
After gene expression analysis, a total of 24 patients (SR 
N = 17, AF N = 7) were selected for assessing serum 
quantification of proteins whose genes were shown to 
be increased by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in AF 
patients (TIMP1 and 2, see below). ELISA assays were 
performed following the manufacturer’s instructions 
(Abcam, ab187394 Human TIMP-1 SimpleStep ELISA 
Kit, and ab100653 TIMP2 Human ELISA kit).
Statistical analysis
IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 was used for all statisti-
cal analyses. Categorical variables were presented as per-
centages and continuous variables as mean and standard 
deviation (sd). Categorical variables were analysed using 
the Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test when appropri-
ate and continuous variables were analysed with a t-test 
for independent samples. Linear regression was per-
formed to correlate continuous variables and results are

Results
Patient demographics
Participants had a mean age of 70.85 ± 10.00 years, with 
males representing 49.2% of patients. The most common 
comorbidity was hypertension, representing 64.4% of 
patients, while 20.3% had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Smok-
ing habits were present in 8.5% of participants, although 
there was no chronic kidney disease in this cohort. Only 
2 patients had a previous acute myocardial infarction 
(3.4%), though 15.3% revealed coronary artery disease on 
coronary angiography. Moreover, 2 patients had a history 
of cerebrovascular disease (3.4%). Symptoms of heart 
failure (NYHA > I) were present in 55.9% of patients, with 
NYHA class II being the most prevalent stage (54.2%); 
15.3% of patients suffered from angina, while only 5.1% 
had complaints of syncope or lipothymia. Solely one 
patient had decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. 
Nonetheless, 64.4% had increased left atrium diameter. 
Aortic valve stenosis was severe, with a mean aortic valve 
maximum gradient of 83.04 ± 20.47  mmHg, an aortic 
valve mean gradient of 51.32 ± 12.36 mmHg and an aor-
tic valve area of 0.76 ± 0.16 cm2.
Concerning SR and AF patient subgroups, AF patients 
were older (AF 75.47 ± 7.71 vs SR 68.98 ± 10.23  years, 
p = 0.023). There were no other differences between 
groups regarding demographics, comorbidities, and 
echocardiographic data (Table 2).
Atrial fibrillation
Histomorphometric analysis
Fibrosis was significantly increased in the AF group when 
compared to SR patients, with a mean ± SD percent 
fibrosis of 38 ± 6% and 25 ± 2%, respectively (p = 0.024). 
Moreover, cardiomyocyte area was significantly higher in 
AF patients versus SR patients—334.1 ± 18.31 µm2 versus 
289.3 ± 6.18 µm2 (p = 0.008) (Fig. 1).
Extracellular matrix gene expression analysis
Collagen gene expression was evaluated to explore 
the differences in fibrosis observed through histologic 
examination. Atrial expression of collagen I was similar 
between groups  (2−ΔCT): AF 2.86 × 10–5 ± 7.03 × 10–6 ver-
sus SR 1.67 × 10–5 ± 4.71 × 10–6 (p = 0.176). Conversely, 
collagen III gene expression was increased in AF patients: 
1.46 × 10–4 ± 2.62 × 10–5 versus 8.39 × 10–5 ± 1.11 × 10–5 
(p = 0.038). The collagen ratio I/III was, nonetheless, 
similar between AF and SR patients: 0.24 ± 0.05 versus 
0.23 ± 0.06 (p = 0.928). Data is depicted in Fig. 2.
A further analysis on extracellular matrix genes was 
performed, with several MMPs and TIMPs tested 
for their atrial expression. MMP2 expression analysis 
showed no differences between groups: AF 1.42 × 10–
4 ± 2.35 × 10–5 versus SR 1.59 × 10–4 ± 1.40 × 10 
−5 
(p = 0.536). MMP9 and MMP16 were similar between 
patients, showing no differential atrial expression: 
1.27 × 10–6 ± 2.77 × 10–7 versus 1.57 × 10–6 ± 3.25 × 10–
7 
(p = 0.509) 
and 
4.35 × 10–6 ± 7.08 × 10–7 
versus 
5.86 × 10–6 ± 6.66 × 10–7 (p = 0.141), respectively. In 
addition, TGFβ1 gene expression analysis was similar 
between patient groups: 4.65 × 10–5 ± 5.75 × 10–6 ver-
sus 5.96 × 10–5 ± 1.01 × 10–5 (p = 0.291) (Fig.  3). On the 
other hand, TIMP1 was less expressed in the atria of 
AF patients: 3.69 × 10–4 ± 5.82 × 10–5 versus 5.72 × 10–
4 ± 7.41 × 10–5 (p = 0.052). TIMP2 presented similar 
results, demonstrating a significantly decreased expres-
sion in the AF group: 2.37 × 10–4 ± 3.04 × 10–5 versus 
3.75 × 10–4 ± 4.37 × 10–5 (p = 0.026). Conversely, TIMP4 
did not show differences between patients: 3.88 × 10–
5 ± 1.17 × 10–5 versus 2.17 × 10–5 ± 4.06 × 10–6 (p = 0.167) 
(Fig. 4).
Moreover, well recognized ratios such as MMP2/
TIMP1, MMP2/TIMP2 and MMP9/TIMP1 were 
tested for their relationship with AF. MMP2/TIMP1 
did not present differences between groups, with a 
ratio of 0.35 ± 0.07 in AF patients and 0.26 ± 0.03 in 
SR patients (p = 0.201). Likewise, both the MMP2/
TIMP2 and MMP9/TIMP1 ratios were similar between

Serum TIMP1 and TIMP2
The counterpart proteins to the altered gene expres-
sion in AF patients (TIMP1 and TIMP2, p = 0.052 and 
p = 0.026, respectively) were quantified in the serum 
of both AF and SR patient groups. TIMP1 was sig-
nificantly increased in the serum of AF patients: AF 
6472.0 ± 958.9  pg/mL versus SR 3612.0 ± 385.4  pg/mL 
(p = 0.004). Similarly, TIMP2 was increased in the AF 
patient group: 144.2 ± 30.6  pg/mL versus 93.4 ± 5.7  pg/
mL (p = 0.012) (Fig. 6).
Aortic stenosis severity
The severity of aortic stenosis was evaluated through aor-
tic valve maximum and mean gradients, as well as aortic 
valve area. These predictors were correlated with histo-
logical parameters and extracellular matrix gene expres-
sion and serum proteins. Results are presented in Table 3.
Histomorphometric analysis
Neither the aortic valve maximum gradient (p = 0.920 
and p = 0.250) nor its mean gradient (p = 0.850 and 
p = 0.421) correlated with fibrosis or atrial cardiomyocyte 
size, respectively. However, aortic valve area was nega-
tively correlated with cardiomyocyte area—B coefficient 
[95% CI] −  0.001 [−  0.002 to −  2.6 × 10–5], p = 0.043 
(Fig. 7). In addition, fibrosis was not correlated with aor-
tic valve area (p = 0.251).
Extracellular matrix gene expression analysis
Aortic valve maximum gradient was inversely correlated 
with the expression of COL1A1 gene (B −  493,531.00 
[− 929322.42 to − 57,739.00], p = 0.029), as well as the 
COL1A1/3A1 gene expression ratio (B − 88.73 [− 165.76 
to −  11.71], p = 0.027). (Fig.  8) Furthermore, MMP2/
TIMP1 ratio presented a tendency towards signifi-
cance, with a B coefficient of − 79.73 [− 159.87 to 0.42], 
p = 0.051. The remaining extracellular genes were not 
correlated with aortic valve maximum gradient (Table 3).
Similarly, aortic valve mean gradient was negatively 
correlated with COL1A1 expression (B −  248,924.75 
[−  492536.12 to −  5313.37], p = 0.046), COL1A1/3A1 
ratio (B −  44.44 [−  87.66 to −  1.22], p = 0.045) and 
MMP2/TIMP1 ratio (B −  44.42 [−  87.46 to −  1.38], 
p = 0.044). (Fig. 9) Other matrix genes remained similar 
regardless of aortic valve mean gradient (Table 3).
Additionally, aortic valve area presented a positive cor-
relation with the gene expression of COL1A1 (B 4045.91 
[564.09–7527.72], p = 0.026) and COL1A1/3A1 ratio (B 
0.68 [0.05–1.32], p = 0.037) (Fig. 7), although other extra-
cellular matrix genes presented no relation with valve 
area (Table 3).
Serum TIMP1 and TIMP2
Aortic valve maximum gradient demonstrated a negative 
association with serum TIMP1, with a B coefficient of 
− 0.004 [− 0.006 to − 0.001], p = 0.015. (Fig. 8) Likewise, 
aortic valve mean gradient was negatively correlated 
with serum TIMP1—B −  0.002 [−  0.004 to −  0.0002], 
p = 0.031. (Fig.  9) No other associations were observed 
regarding aortic valve function and serum TIMP1 and 
TIMP2 (Table 3).
Discussion
This is the first study evaluating atrial remodelling in aor-
tic stenosis patients with chronic AF, both fibrosis quan-
tification and target extracellular matrix protein gene 
expression analysis. AF patients were older, had increased 
cardiomyocyte area and atrial fibrosis on histologic quan-
tification, increased collagen type III gene expression, as 
well as decreased TIMP1 and TIMP2 gene expression. 
Moreover, MMP16/TIMP4 ratio was decreased in AF 
patients. Serum TIMP1 and TIMP2 proteins were both 
increased in the AF patient subgroup.
Aortic stenosis patients with AF were older than their 
SR counterparts. Age is the most common and consist-
ently described risk factor for AF, regardless of the car-
diovascular disease background [4, 14]. Patients with AF 
had increased fibrosis, as demonstrated by histology sec-
tions, as well as increased cardiomyocyte size, suggested 
by the higher cell area. There is extensive evidence on the 
role of atrial fibrosis in sustaining the arrhythmia [15], 
although studies on aortic stenosis are scarce. Studies on 
animal models with increased afterload but absent hyper-
tension suggest atrial remodeling increases AF inducibil-
ity through atrial myocardium fibrosis [16]. On the other 
hand, fibrosis evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance 
imaging suggests a correlation with atrial fibrillation in

stimulating fibroblast proliferation which leads to cardiac 
fibrosis [18]. Fibroblast-cardiomyocyte coupling might 
slow conduction, therefore promoting re-entrance mech-
anisms, as well as enhance phase 4 depolarization, induc-
ing ectopic impulse generation [19]. This cell-to-cell 
interaction depends on the degree of coupling, the num-
ber of coupled fibroblasts to each cardiomyocyte, and the 
relative size of cardiomyocytes versus fibroblasts [20]. 
Furthermore, the increased cardiomyocyte cell area in AF 
patients might correspond to a glycogen accumulation, 
with depletion of contractile material, as demonstrated in 
a study of sustained AF in goats with a substantial pro-
portion of atrial myocytes with marked ultrastructure 
changes, including loss of myofibrils and accumulation 
of glycogen [21]. Studies on dogs with mitral valve ste-
nosis have reported atrial cardiomyocyte hypertrophy 
with decreased myofibrils [21, 22]. Despite the absence of 
studies on aortic stenosis patients, it has been reported 
similar degenerative cardiomyocyte changes in patients 
submitted to cardiac surgery, which correlate with atrial 
size and pressure, along with diastolic dysfunction [23].

In addition to the increase in atrial fibrosis in histol-
ogy sections, mRNA expression of collagen type III was 
higher in AF patients, although collagen I and collagen 
I/III ratio did not present differences between groups. 
Zhang et al. reported an increase in atrial mRNA expres-
sion of collagen I and III in AF patients with rheumatic 
heart disease [24]. Likewise, Cao et al. reported a simi-
lar increase in patients with permanent AF undergoing 
valvular replacement [25]. Conversely, Yoshihara et  al. 
found a decrease in mRNA expression of both collagen 
type I and III in patients with AF submitted to Kosakai’s 
modified maze procedure [26]. The present study focused 
on AF patients with aortic stenosis submitted to valve 
replacement, which could explain the isolated increase in 
type III collagen gene expression between patient groups.
Regarding atrial extracellular matrix gene expres-
sion, TGF-β1 was similar between groups. TGFβ1 is an 
established positive regulator of cardiac fibrosis [27], 
is upregulated in AF patients with mitral valve disease 
submitted to valve replacement, and [28] postoperative 
AF in patients submitted to myocardial revasculariza-
tion [29]. Nevertheless, studies on aortic stenosis are 
scarce. MMP2, MMP9, and MMP16 showed no statisti-
cally significant differences between AF and SR patient 
subgroups. However, TIMP1 and TIMP2 were decreased 
in AF (p = 0.052 and p = 0.026, respectively), with no 
differences in gene expression for TIMP4. Regarding 
MMP/TIMP ratios, MMP2/TIMP1, MMP2/TIMP2, and 
MMP9/TIMP1 were similar in AF participants when 
compared to their SR counterparts. Conversely, MMP2/
TIMP4 demonstrated a tendency towards significance, 
being decreased in AF patients, while MMP16/TIMP4 
was significantly lower in this patient subgroup. Extracel-
lular matrix remodeling is induced by collagen digestion 
through MMPs with tightly opposing inhibitors (TIMPs) 
[30]. Findings vary according to experimental conditions, 
target extracellular matrix proteins, type of cardiovas-
cular disease, and AF progression [1]. Polyakova et  al. 
found increased atrial expression of MMP2, MMP9, and 
TIMP1, although no differences in TIMP4, in AF patients 
submitted to a mini-Maze procedure [31]. Conversely, 
there were no differences in MMP9 atrial expression 
in AF patients with heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction [32]. Despite a similar expression of TIMP4 
between groups, MMP2/TIMP4 and MMP16/TIMP4 
ratios demonstrated a decrease in AF patients. MMP2/
TIMP4 ratio has been reported to be increased in heart 
failure induced by occlusion of the left coronary artery

in spontaneously hypertensive rats [33]. Additionally, 
Wetzl et al. found a correlation between MMP2/TIMP4 
ratio and mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary 
vascular resistance, estimated glomerular filtration rate, 
and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. Remark-
ably, MMP16/TIMP4 was overwhelmingly decreased in 
AF patients. This is the first study that suggests MMP16/
TIMP4 as a marker of disease, specifically, a marker of 
chronic AF in aortic stenosis patients. Furthermore, 
although a significantly decreased atrial gene expression 
(TIMP1 and TIMP2) was observed, AF patients’ serum 
TIMP1 and TIMP2 proteins were significantly increased. 
This might represent a downregulation of expression 
when considering increased protein levels. The increase 
in matrix inhibitors when comparing with proteolytic 
enzymes (decreased MMP/TIMP ratios) may explain the 
collagen accumulation seen by histology, in addition to 
the increased mRNA collagen type III expression.
Concerning aortic stenosis severity, Aortic Valve 
Maximum and Mean Gradients were negatively cor-
related with collagen type I gene expression, collagen 
type I/III ratio, and serum TIMP1 protein levels. Addi-
tionally, MMP2/TIMP1 ratio was inversely correlated 
with aortic valve mean gradient. Aortic valve area was 
positively correlated with collagen type I gene expres-
sion and collagen type I/III ratio. Moreover, aortic valve 
area was negatively associated with cardiomyocyte cell 
area. Although the classical aortic valve stenosis sever-
ity definition remains dependent on transthoracic 
echocardiography and its parameters, such as maxi-
mal aortic velocity (severe, > 4  m/s), mean pressure 
gradient (severe, > 40  mmHg) and aortic valve area 
(severe, > 1 cm2), the interplay between comorbidities and 
aortic stenosis risk of progression remains incompletely 
understood [34, 35]. AF in aortic stenosis is associated 
with lower maximum and mean pressure gradients, 
which could lead to a misclassification of disease sever-
ity, since AF represents an independent risk factor for 
adverse outcomes, including all-cause mortality [36]. The 
obstruction caused by aortic stenosis leads to pressure 
overload and, ultimately, to ventricular hypertrophy and 
cardiac fibrosis [37]. Azevedo et al. found the amount of 
myocardial fibrosis is associated with all-cause mortality 
after aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aor-
tic stenosis, indicating tissue fibrosis could be a marker 
of disease severity [38]. Overall, our results indicate an 
adverse remodelling in patients with lower maximum 
and mean pressure gradients, which can be explained by 
the presence of AF in this cohort. AF patients have worse 
remodelling and lower gradients, thus patients with 
more collagen deposition will be those with, apparently, 
less severe stenosis. However, a higher degree of fibrosis 
is associated with worse outcomes. Our results suggest 
several matrix proteins which could be implicated in dis-
ease severity besides histological fibrosis. Serum TIMP1 
could be a marker of adverse outcomes in aortic stenosis, 
in addition to conventional echocardiography.
This study indicates an atrial matrix remodeling in 
aortic stenosis patients with chronic AF submitted to 
valve replacement while suggesting TIMP1 and TIMP2 
as biomarkers of disease, readily available with periph-
eral blood sampling. MMP16/TIMP4 ratio is increased 
in AF and potentially a novel marker of this arrhythmia. 
Although the number of patients analysed is relatively 
low and thus further studies on chronic AF are needed, 
this is the first study on atrial matrix remodelling in aor-
tic stenosis patients with atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions
Atrial fibrillation patients with severe aortic stenosis pre-
sent increased atrial fibrosis and collagen type III synthe-
sis, with extracellular matrix remodelling demonstrated 
by a decrease in the MMP16/TIMP4 ratio, along with 
an increased serum TIMP1 and TIMP2 proteins. TIMP1 
could be a marker of adverse outcomes in aortic stenosis, 
in addition to conventional echocardiography.
