Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus
pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was
reported in Wuhan city, China. Since then, COVID-19
had rapidly spread to more than 17.6 million cases, with
over 680,000 deaths worldwide as of August 2, 2020 [1].
A total of 84,428 cases and 4,634 deaths were reported
in China, and approximately 81% of cases and 97% of
deaths were from Wuhan city of August 2, 2020 [2]. As
the hardest-hit city by the COVID-19 pandemic, Wuhan
initiated a metropolitan-wide quarantine on January 23,
2020, which terminated all public transportation in the
city and intercity links. The quarantine lasted for 76 days
and was eventually lifted on April 8, 2020 [3–6]. The metropolitan-
wide quarantine approach had since become
a common practice to combat the COVID-19 epidemic
globally.
At the peak of the epidemic, Wuhan authorities constructed
an emergency hospital specialized in treating
people infected with SARS-CoV-2, inspired by the prefab
hospital erected in Beijing during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
This emergency hospital, Huoshenshan hospital,
was constructed within ten days and the first hospital
specialized in treating patients with COVID-19 in the
world [7–9]. This hospital closed on April 15, 2020, one
week after the metropolitan-wide quarantine was lifted
[10]. During the 73 days of operation, the hospital treated
3,059 patients with COVID-19, of whom 2,961 recovered
[7].
Identifying the risk factors of COVID-19 disease progression
and fatality provides important evidence to
support appropriate clinical management and optimize
medical resource allocation [11–13]. The risk factors
for COVID-19 progression include comorbidities with
chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease and liver disease), old age, low lymphocyte and
albumin counts and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase,
c-reactive protein, red blood cell distribution width,
blood urea nitrogen and direct bilirubin [14]. In particular,
patients with old age, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia,
higher lactate dehydrogenase and d-dimer levels
were more likely to develop Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS) [15, 16]. Further, older age, d-dimer
level greater than 1 μg/mL and a high Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment score on admission would contribute
to a higher in-hospital fatality of COVID-19 patients [17].
Liang et al. [18], based on chest radiography abnormality
and nine clinical indicators were able to predict the
risk of developing critical illness with an area-underthe-
curve of 0.88. A systematic review and meta-analysis
examine risk factors associated with adverse clinical outcomes
in patients with COVID-19 [19]. However, most of
these studies were limited by their relatively small sample
sizes, and many patients had not progressed to the study
endpoints by the time the study was conducted, leading
to bias and unreliable prediction for disease progression
and fatality. Besides, some analyses of risk factors were
not adjusted for potential confounding effects, leading to
false associations.
In this study, we retrospectively collected the complete
hospitalization information from 2,433 patients
who were admitted to Huoshenshan hospital during its
73 days of operation. We explored on the time for disease
progression among patients in various disease stages at
admission and determined their risk of disease progression.
We also identified clinical risk factors that predict
the COVID-19 disease progression and fatality among
these patients.
Methods
Study design and patients
We established a retrospective observational study
cohort, based on 3,059 cases admitted to the Huoshenshan
hospital in Wuhan between February 4 and April 15,
2020. The exclusion criteria were: (1) Patients who were
not confirmed by a positive result of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 detection in respiratory
specimens by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction assay, or in serum by the specific IgM and IgG
antibody detection; (2) Patients who referred to other
medical institution during hospitalization; (3) Patients
who were admitted to the hospital multiple times; (4)
Patients were younger than 18 years old; (5) Patients
without laboratory data included in this study within the
24 h after admission. This study tracked the progression
of COVID-19 patients from admission until one of the
endpoints (discharged or death).
Clinical and outcome indicators
Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and clinical
outcome data were obtained from the hospital’s
electronic clinical medical records. At the first clinical
consultation, demographic, clinical and laboratory
data were collected within the first day after admission.
Treatment data and clinical outcomes (including the
event of disease progression, time of each disease stages,
fatality, duration of hospitalization and endpoint status)
were also collected during the course from admission
to the study endpoints. We defined the event of disease
progression as a mild or moderate patient at admission
would progress to severe or critical stage at the first time
during hospitalization.
Clinical definitions
The severity of COVID-19 was defined according to the
Guidance 7th edition [20]. Patients were classified as
‘mild’ if there was no evidence of pneumonia on imaging
nor any of the features for moderate or higher severity;
as ‘moderate’ if they had evidence of pneumonia on
imaging but no features of severe or higher severity;
as ‘severe’ if they meet any of the following criteria: (1)
respiratory distress (≥ 30 breaths/min); (2) oxygen saturation
≤ 93% at rest on room air; (3) arterial partial pressure
of oxygen (PaO2) or fraction of inspired oxygen
(FiO2) ≦ 300 mmHg (l mmHg = 0.133 kPa); and as ‘critical’
if they required mechanical ventilation, had a septic
shock or required admission to ICU. Comorbidities were
defined according to ICD10-CM code [21]. Detailed definitions
for clinical symptoms were provided in the supplemental
materials. We considered a patient progressing
to a severe or critical disease stage when the individual
had none of the severe or critical stages at admission
but developed these stages for the first time during
hospitalization.
Patients had to meet all the following criteria before
being discharged: (1) body temperature returned to normal
(< 37.5 °C) for three consecutive days; (2) respiratory
symptoms improved substantially; (3) pulmonary imaging
showed an obvious absorption of inflammation; and
(4) two consecutive negative nuclei acid tests, each at
least 24 h apart.
Statistical analysis
We presented continuous variables as the median and
interquartile range (IQR) and examined the differences
between disease severity groups using the Kruskal–Wallis
one-way ANOVA We presented categorical variables
with the corresponding percentage and examined the differences
using χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test. We conducted
survival analyses on disease progression and fatality
based on a competing risk framework. The outcome variables
included: (1) the event of the first time disease progression
to severe or critical disease states among mild
or moderate patients at admission, and (2) in-hospital
fatality among patients with severe or critical at admission.
Discharge from the hospital was considered as a
competing risk event. Five clinical indicators (interleukin-
6, natriuretic peptide type B, supersensitive troponin
I, myoglobin and procalcitonin.) with more than 30% of
entries missing were excluded from the analysis. Data
imputation was performed if missing percentage < 30%
using Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations.
Statistically significant variables in the univariate analysis
were ranked and further selected using LASSO
regression [22]. The number of variables was defined
as the number of variables when λ = λmin in LASSO,
or the total number of events divided by 10 (event per
variable > 10 rule)[23], whichever is smaller. Variables,
which particularly reported in previous literatures were
included in final analysis. The pooled set of variables were
then included for the final multivariable cause-specific
Cox proportional hazard model. Cumulative incidence
curves were plotted to demonstrate the incidence of differences
between different risk levels of key variables. A
p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were conducted using the R software
(version 3.6.1).
Results
Demographic characteristics of patients
After excluding 214 patients who were only diagnosed
clinically according to the Guidance 7th edition [20],
46 patients who referred to other medical institution,
16 patients who were admitted to the hospital multiple
times, six patients were younger than 18 years old.
Further, we excluded 328 patients without laboratory
data included in this study within the 24 h after admission,
we included 2,433 COVID-19 patients in the final
analysis. Fifty patients died during hospitalization, and
2,383 were discharged, corresponding to a case-fatality
ratio of 2.1%. Patient’s median age was 60.0 years (IQR
50.0–68.0), and 50.2% were male (Table 1). The most
common symptoms or signs on admission were cough
(55.7%), fatigue (38.9%), and shortness of breath (25.0%).
Hypertension being the most common comorbidity
(31.6%), followed by diabetes (14.3%) and coronary
heart disease (6.7%). During hospitalization, 847 (34.8%)
patients received antibiotics, 1233 (50.7%) received antivirals,
and 68 (2.8%) received non-invasive mechanical
ventilation and 42 (1.7%) received invasive mechanical
ventilation.
Clinical progression and regression during hospitalization
Among 25 mild patients at admission, 19 retained mild
and were discharged after 6.0 (5.0–11.0) days; six patients
who progressed to moderate severity in 3.0 (1.8–5.5)
days, but all discharged after another 8.0 (6.8–8.8) days.
Of 1,733 moderate patients at admission, 1,259 patients
retained moderate and discharged after 11.0 (7.0–16.0)
days. In contrast, 474 patients progressed to the severe
state in 3.0 (1.0–7.0) days, but all recovered and were discharged
after another 12.0 (6.5–18.0) days, and 9 patients
deceased after 9.0 (2.5–19.0) days. Of 635 severe patients
at admission, 604 patients regressed to moderate severity
in 7.0 (5.0–11.0) days and were discharged after another
6.0 (4.0–11.0) days. Thirty-one patients progressed to
critical severity after 3.0 (1.8–8.0) days, and of whom
only 10 patients were discharged after 15.5 (14.0–30.5)
days, and 21 died after 6.0 (0.0–10.5) days. Of 40 critical
patients at admission, 20 patients regressed to moderate
severity after 10.5 (8.3–15.8) days and were discharged
after another 11.5 (6.3–19.5) days, and the remaining 20
patients died after 6.5 (4.0–16.3) days (Figs. 1 and 2).
Across all patients, it required a median of 3.0 (1.8–5.5)
days to progress from mild to moderate, 3.0 (1.0–7.0)
days from moderate to severe, 3.0 (1.0–8.0) days from
severe to critical and 6.5 (4.0–16.3) from critical to fatality.
In contrast, it required 7.0 (5.0–11.0) days to regress
from severe or critical to moderate severity and 6.5
(4.0–11.0) days from moderate to discharge. The median
admission-to-discharge time among mild, moderate,
severe and critical patients on admission were 7.0 (5.5–
12.0), 13.0 (9.0–19.0), 15.0 (8.0–22.0), and 25.0 (15.3–
34.8) days, respectively.
Contributing factors to disease progression and COVID‑19
fatality
Of 1,758 mild and moderate patients at admission,
474 (27.0%) progressed to severe or critical severity
during hospitalization. Multi-variable cause-specific
Cox proportional hazard model (Table 2) identified
that patients with age 60–74 years (HR = 1.26, 95%CI
1.02–1.56), > 74 years (1.44, 1.02–2.03), respiratory
rate > 20 times/min (1.28, 1.05–1.57), fever (temperature
≥ 37.5 °C) (1.93, 1.21–3.08), chest tightness (1.47,
1.12–1.92), blood glucose > 6.1 mmol/L (1.58, 1.25–
1.98), c-reaction protein > 4 mg/L (1.45, 1.12–1.87), lactate
dehydrogenase > 250 IU/L (1.63, 1.20–2.20), direct
bilirubin > 8 μmol/L (1.51, 1.03, 2.21), albumin < 40 g/L
(1.38, 1.07–1.77) and lymphocyte count < 1.1*109/L (1.44,
1.15–1.81) were risk factors for disease progression to
severe and critical stage (Table 2). The 21-day cumulative
incidence of progression was 47.8% in > 74-years age
group, followed by 32.4%, 19.8% in age groups of 60–74
and < 60-years respectively. The cumulative incidence of
disease progression at day 21 was also much higher in
patients with blood glucose ≥ 6.1 mmol/L (40.8%) than
blood glucose in range of 3.9–6.1 mmol/L (21.4%, Fig. 3a,
b).
Of 675 severe or critical patients at admission, 634
(93.9%) were discharged and 41 (6.1%) died during hospitalization.
Table 2 showed that patients with age > 74 years
(3.41, 1.07–10.89), blood glucose > 6.1 mmol/L (3.22,
1.54–6.73), platelets count < 125*109/L (4.39, 2.02–9.54),
fibrinogen < 2 g/L (6.48, 1.46–28.67) and creatine kinase-
MB > 24 IU/L (6.29, 2.51–15.80) were risk factors for
in-hospital fatality (Table 2). The 21-day cumulative incidence
of fatality was 13.1% in > 74 years age group, 4.6%,
1.4% in age groups of 60–74, < 60 years respectively. The
incidence of fatality at day 21 was four times higher in
patients with blood glucose > 6.1 g/L (11.8%) than blood
glucose in range of 3.9–6.1 mmol/L (2.7%, Fig. 3c, d).
Discussion
Our study provides unique progression and outcome
data on a cohort of 2,433 COVID-19 patients admitted
to Huoshenshan hospital, a hospital designed and built
solely to provide care to patients with COVID-19. Our
findings suggest that even among inpatients with moderately
severe disease, the fatality was relatively low. Most
deaths arose from patients who were critically ill on
admission or progressed to being critical during admission.
The risk factors we identified for death and disease
progression are similar to previous studies with older age,
poor systematic immune and inflammatory responses,
and multiple organ damages [14–16, 18, 24–32]. Patients
admitted with a greater disease severity requires longer
to recover.
Our report on the time for disease progression at each
disease stages allows early preparation and intervention
to delay disease progression (Fig. 2). Since there is no
effective cure for COVID-19, delaying the progression
of the disease is key for survival. Most mild or moderate
patients (73.0%) did not progress to severe or critical
states and recovered from COVID-19 infection in 10.0
(7.0–15.0) days. But among those who did progress, they
progressed to a severe or critical stage within the first 3.0
(1.0–7.0) days after admission. This highlights the importance
of close monitoring of key risk indicators for disease
progression in the early stages of infection. Because,
once a patient reaches the critical stage, the chance of
fatality is 62.5% in a short period of 6.5 (2.0–13.3) days.
We identified the blood glucose level to be an important
prognostic predictor for both COVID-19 progression
and fatality. In particular, patients with an elevated
level of blood glucose > 6.1 mmol/L had a 58% higher risk
of disease progression and 3.22-fold higher risk of fatality.
This is consistent with previous reports that a high
glucose level contributes to the development of acute
respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients [16,
17, 28, 29]. Uncontrolled blood glucose level also substantially
contributes to other comorbidities, including
atherosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy, peripheral arteriosclerosis,
and diabetic ketoacidosis, which are also causes
of COVID-19 related fatality [28, 33]. The underlying
mechanism of how blood glucose interacts with SARSCOV-
2 is currently unclear. SARS-COV-2 relies on the
binding to membrane angiotensin-converting enzyme-2
(ACE-2) receptor to enter pulmonary cells in the lungs.
We speculate that diabetic patients have elevated expression
of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors,
making them vulnerable to SARS-COV-2 infection.
Besides, patients living with diabetes or uncontrolled
glucose level are likely to have impaired innate immunity
due to dysfunction of macrophage and lymphocytes,
which may lead to an increased risk of septic shock and
multiple organ failures. Hyperglycemia is also a potential
indicator of pancreatic islet cell injury [33]. Effective
glycemic monitor and management may be beneficial to
reduce the progression and fatality of COVID-19 patients
[34, 35].
Our study reported important clinical indicators that
are associated with COVID-19 disease progression and
fatality. At the systemic level, a low lymphocyte count
is an indication of a poor systematic immune response
against the infection, whereas a high c-reactive protein
level is an early indicator of systemic inflammatory
response syndrome [36]. Besides, increased fibrinogen
and platelets count concentrations are associated with
increased coagulation activity in patients with infection
or sepsis [37, 38]. This is particularly life-threatening
for patients with pre-existing cerebro-or cardiovascular
diseases, which is common among the elderly. In addition,
an elevated creatine kinase-MB level, a know indicator
for acute myocardial injury. Further, liver damage
or dysfunction, marked by reduced albumin level and
elevated direct bilirubin [39]. Most of the remaining
indicators may be associated with multiple organ injury
or failure. Lactate dehydrogenase predicts the severity
of tissue damage. As lactate dehydrogenase is largely
present in lung tissues, when damaged by SARS-COV-2
infection, a large amount of lactate dehydrogenase into
the circulation. This often clinically presents as a severe
form of interstitial pneumonia and subsequently evolve
into acute respiratory distress syndrome. Elevated lactate
dehydrogenase level is also a predictor of endothelial
damage, which caused microvascular thrombosis and
associated with renal failure [40]. Maintaining an effective
systemic immune response against the infection and
prevention of multiple organ failures are, therefore, the
priorities in treating COVID-19 patients.
Our study has several limitations. First, this is a retrospective
single-centre study, and almost half of patients
did not have laboratory tests for interleukin-6, natriuretic
peptide type B, supersensitive troponin I, myoglobin and
procalcitonin levels within the first day after admission.
Their role may be underestimated in the prediction of
disease progression and fatality. Second, most patients
on admission had moderate severity which may lead to
a selection bias when identifying factors that affect progression
or fatality. Additional cohort studies of patients
with COVID-19 pneumonia from areas outside Wuhan
are needed to confirm our results. Third, considering
both the small number of events and the rule of thumb
on event per variable > 10, only limited risk factors were
included in the multivariable analysis of severe and critically
illness at admission to fatality during hospitalization.
Fourth, most patients were referred from other
medical institution, and the data at diagnosis was not
accessible to us.
Conclusions
In this study, we comprehensively presented stage-wise
disease’s first progression among COVID-19 patients.
We identified that older age, elevated glucose level,
together with other clinical indicators associated with
systemic responses and multiple organ failures, predicted
both the disease progression and fatality among COVID-
19 patients.
