Background
Classical insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) is characterized
by extremely high serum insulin concentrations,
as well as spontaneous hypoglycemia [1]. In IAS, there
are also high titers of autoantibodies against endogenous
insulin, which occur without any prior exposure to exogenous
insulin [2, 3]. Hypoglycemia that results from
exogenous insulin administration can also manifest with
symptoms resembling those of IAS. Patients usually
present with postprandial hypoglycemia, marked neuroglycopenic
symptoms of confusion, and an altered state
of consciousness in these two conditions [1]. In this case
series, we introduce a new concept of non-classical IAS
and elaborate on insulin-resistant syndrome, as well as
relationships with other hyperinsulinemic diseases.
Research methods
All the measurements of hormone were made in the
Laboratory of The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang
University. Serum insulin concentrations were measured by
automated microparticle enzyme immunoassays (Abbott
AxSYM MEIA; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL,
USA). C-peptide concentrations were measured by a
specific immunoradiometric assay (Immunotech, Prague,
Czech Republic). The qualitatively assessment of circulating
immune complexes were precipitation with polyethylene
glycol followed by an insulin assay of the supernatant [2].
The reduced accuracy of insulin measurement is not clinically
relevant in patients with IAS because of the high serum
insulin values. Moreover, there is no cross-reactivity
of the insulin assay with synthetic insulin in this detection
method.
Case presentations
Case 1
This patient was a 79-year-old man who had a 10-year
history of hyperglycemia in addition to fluctuating glucose
concentrations for more than 1 year. This was accompanied
by diabetic nephropathy as well as a history of gout for
more than 30 years. His glucose concentrations were
initially well controlled with metformin after diagnosis of
type 2 diabetes mellitus. A subcutaneous insulin pump
(lispro) was recently added to his treatment regimen for
renal insufficiency, and metformin was gradually changed
to Humulin R (6–4-4 units, three times a day) combined
with glargine 12 units a day. Thereafter, he had recurrent
midnight hypoglycemia and daytime hyperglycemia, with
blood glucose concentrations up to 20mmol/L. Therefore,
he was treated with acarbose (50 mg three times a day) instead
of insulin injections. At this time, his C-peptide
values were 5.45/6.94/6.94/7.89/7.17 nmol/L at 0/0.5/1/2/
3 h, respectively (normal range: 0.27–1.28 nmol/L). His
insulin concentrations were > 1000.00/> 1000.00 pmol/L at
0/2 h, respectively (normal range: 13–161 pmol/L), during
an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), his HbA1c concentration
was 10.2%, and an anti-insulin antibody test was
positive (reference level: < 0.4). His glucose concentrations
still fluctuated between 11mmol/L and 22mmol/L in the
daytime, while hypoglycemia occurred at night. Subsequently,
acarbose (100–100-50mg three times a day) and
sitagliptin (50 mg per day) were prescribed for symptom
management, and his glucose concentrations returned to
the normal range. Laboratory findings at a 1-year follow-up
showed an HbA1c concentration of 7.0%, insulin concentrations
of 138.53/733.40 pmol/L at 0/2 h, and C-peptide
concentrations of 1.35/2.21 nmol/L at 0/2 h, respectively.
Case 2
This patient was a 71-year-old man who was admitted
because of polydipsia and polyuria that had persisted for
8 years, as well as recurrent episodes of unconsciousness
throughout this period. He was diagnosed with type 2
diabetes mellitus 8 years before admission. Acarbose was
initially prescribed, but was switched to insulin aspart 30
(8–12 units twice a day) because of poor glucose control
5 years previously. Three months previously, the dose of
insulin aspart 30 was gradually reduced to 4–10 units
because of hypoglycemia. However, he had unexpected
episodes of unconsciousness due to hypoglycemia 12
days before admission. Moreover, his symptoms were
obviously relieved after food intake. He was subsequently
treated with voglibose instead of insulin injections. However,
the hypoglycemic symptoms continued to appear
between 02:00 am and 03:00 am, despite the absence of
other treatments. A laboratory examination showed the
following: C-peptide values were 15.22/17.59/19.73/
15.22 nmol/L at 0/1/2/3 h, and insulin concentrations
were > 2089.5/> 2089.5/> 2089.5/> 2089.5 pmol/L at 0/1/
2/3 h during the OGTT, respectively. The anti-insulin
antibody test was also positive. His treatment regimen
was changed to prednisone (5 mg three times a day),
acarbose (50 mg three times a day), metformin (0.5 g
twice a day), and glargine (12–18 units twice a day) for
glucose control. Insulin injections were also gradually
discontinued. Following this treatment, he showed improved
glucose control. Laboratory tests during a recent
follow-up showed the following: C-peptide levels of
0.77/2.40 nmol/L at 0/2 h and insulin levels of 430.13/
1350.21 pmol/L at 0/2 h during the OGTT, respectively.
Case 3
This patient was a 79-year-old man who presented with
a 3-year history of hyperglycemia and a 1-year history of
polydipsia. At the time of presentation, he had been in a
hypodynamic state for 15 days. Three years previously,
he was diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance without
any symptoms, but no treatment was provided. One
year earlier, he developed polydipsia, hyperuresis, and
cutaneous pruritus, and lost weight. His random plasma
glucose concentrations increased to as high as 20 mmol/
L. Consequently, he was started on aspart 30 (21 units
before breakfast and 8 units before dinner) and metformin
(0.5 g twice a day). One month previously, he visited
our hospital because of complaints of recurrent midnight
hypoglycemia, particularly at approximately 02:00
am. During that period, although an insulin injection
was gradually reduced and subsequently discontinued,
his glucose concentration still dropped to 3 mmol/L.
Laboratory tests showed that C-peptide and insulin concentrations
were above the normal range, and the insulin
autoantibody test was positive. At that time, non-classical
IAS was considered as the probable cause of repeated
hypoglycemia, and treatment was changed to acarbose
(50mg three times a day). After 15 days, blood tests
showed the following: fasting plasma glucose level, 3.71
mmol/L; anti-insulin antibody, > 45.4 U/mL; and insulin
concentrations were 1567.44/1493.06/1370.20/1616.43/
1812.01 pmol/L at 0/30/60/120/180min and C-peptide
concentrations were 3.41/3.68/3.95/4.56/4.51 nmol/L at 0/
30/60/120/180 min during the OGTT, respectively. For
treatment of IAS, prednisone therapy was started at 12 mg
daily (4 mg per dose three time daily) then reduced to 8
mg daily after 2 weeks and to 4 mg per night 1 week later.
The diabetes treatment plan was changed to human biosynthetic
insulin injection (16 units per day), sitagliptin
(50mg per day), and voglibose (0.3–0.2 mg twice a day).
Repeated laboratory tests showed the following: C-peptide
concentrations were 0.73/1.67 nmol/L at 0/2 h, respectively,
and the insulin concentration was 728.14 pmol/L at
0 h during the OGTT. The glucose concentration fluctuated
between 7 and 12.9mmol/L.
Case 4
This patient was a 52-year-old man diagnosed with type 2
diabetes mellitus at the local hospital according to a fasting
glucose test that showed a concentration of 16 mmol/L. His
postprandial glucose concentration was 27 mmol/L. However,
the patient was asymptomatic. He was then treated
with a 50/50 Mixture Recombinant Human Insulin Injection
(Gansulin 50R) of 12–16 units twice a day, and the
dose had been adjusted to 6–10 units 2 months previously.
During this period, his glucose was well controlled. One
month previously, he developed dizziness and was flustered
again. He also started sweating excessively, and at that time,
his fasting plasma glucose concentration was 2.8
mmol/L. One week previously, the treatment was
changed to acarbose 0.1 mg three times a day because of
repeated occurrence of hypoglycemic symptoms. His insulin
concentrations were 1294.01/1303.77/1456.7/2057.11/
2032.41 pmol/L at 0/30/60/120/180min and C-peptide
concentrations were 1.30/1.80/2.21/2.87/2.55 nmol/L at 0/
30/60/120/180 min during the OGTT, respectively. The
anti-insulin antibody test was positive. He was prescribed
metformin (0.5 g twice a day), acarbose (0.05 g three times
a day), aspart (6–5-5 units three times a day), and methylprednisolone
(4mg three times a day) for glucose control.
After these changes, hypoglycemia syndrome did not
recur (Table 1).
Discussion and conclusions
We experienced four cases of IAS that all shared the following
characteristics: [1] recurrent episodes of symptomatic
hypoglycemia [2]; prior exposure to exogenous insulin; and
[3] high concentrations of plasma insulin immunoreactive
antibodies and hyperinsulinemia after discontinuing insulin
injection. All four cases manifested symptoms, such as classical
IAS. Therefore, we temporarily identified these cases as
non-classical IAS. We review hyperinsulinemia-related diseases
and discuss their distinct features compared with other
cases below.
Many endocrine diseases can present with endogenous
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (EHH). EHH is diagnosed
with the presence of inappropriately high serum insulin
concentrations while plasma concentrations of glucose are
< 55mg/dL and ≤ 70mg/dL in individuals with and without
diabetes, respectively [4, 5]. IAS is a rare cause of
EHH, characterized by spontaneous hypoglycemia, extremely
high serum insulin levels (> 1000 pmol/L), and
high titers of insulin autoantibodies against endogenous
insulin [1]. After a meal or oral glucose load, increased 
glucose levels can stimulate insulin secretion, but autoantibodies
bind to these insulin molecules, rendering them
unavailable to exert their effects. The resulting hyperglycemia
further promotes insulin release. The inappropriately
increased concentrations of free insulin eventually
cause hypoglycemia. Most patients with IAS achieve
remission with nutritional management [6], and small
frequent meals with low carbohydrates are preferred [7].
Additionally, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants
are prescribed to ameliorate immune dysregulation as well
as avoid hypoglycemic attacks in IAS [8–12]. Other therapeutic
options have also been shown to be successful in
the management of IAS (e.g., acarbose for decreasing
endogenous insulin secretion) [13]. In addition, plasmapheresis
and rituximab can be used to eliminate insulin
autoantibody titers in the circulation [1, 8, 12].
Aside from IAS, another type of autoimmune hyperinsulinemia
is type B insulin resistance [2, 14]. The diagnosis
of type B insulin resistance syndrome is based on
the presence of antibodies directed against the cell
surface insulin receptor [14–16]. These autoantibodies
prevent endogenous insulin from binding to insulin receptors
and decrease transduction of the insulin signal
[17, 18]. Hyperinsulinemia in these patients has been
attributed to increased secretion of insulin to compensate
for peripheral insulin resistance and concomitant
reduction in insulin clearance [17, 18]. Type B insulin
resistance syndrome is characterized by severe hyperglycemia
and is less common hypoglycemia compared with
IAS [17, 18]. Treatment strategies for type B insulin
resistance syndrome should be based on the specific requirements
and individualized. Many of these patients
undergo spontaneous remission of autoantibodies after
11–48 months of treatment with insulin and an insulin
sensitizer. In severe cases, intravenous methylprednisolone
and cyclophosphamide are recommended [14, 17].
Apart from autoimmune-induced EHH, insulinoma
and nesidioblastosis should also be considered. Insulinoma
is a small (< 2 cm) and benign tumor that is the
most common neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas
[19, 20]. Secretion of endogenous insulin cannot be suppressed
by hypoglycemia in insulinoma [21]. The common
diagnostic criteria for insulinoma include increased concentration
of insulin (≥43.05 pmol/L), C-peptide (≥0.2 nmol/L),
and proinsulin (≥5 pmol/L). Surgical resection is the firstline
treatment for insulinoma [22]. Nesidioblastosis is a
condition involving diffuse hyperplasia of the pancreatic
islets [23]. Formation of nesidioblastosis is attributed to
congenital or acquired excessive function of abnormal pancreatic
β-cells [24]. Additionally, subtotal pancreatectomy is
a good option because of the diffuse nature of the disease
[25] (Table 2). Furthermore, insulin receptor-negative insulin
resistance also leads to hyperinsulinemia. Activation of
the protein kinase Cu and phosphorylated insulin receptor
substrate-1 Ser-307 by intramyocellular lipids can lead to
muscle insulin resistance [26]. Moreover, activation of IκB
kinase affects insulin signaling by phosphorylating and
switching off the function of insulin receptor substrate,
leading to increased insulin concentrations [27]. Hyperinsulinemia
is also present in overtreatment with exogenous
insulin. The difference between exogenous insulin-and
endogenous insulin-induced hyperinsulinemia is the lowering
of plasma glucose, lipoproteins, and inflammatory
markers [28].
In the current case series, each of the four patients was
found to have non-classical IAS with high concentrations
of anti-insulin antibodies that were caused by exogenous
insulin injection. These antibodies can cause hypoglycemia,
even after insulin injection is discontinued. In patients with
classical IAS, hypoglycemia is typically postprandial. As glucose
concentrations eventually fall, insulin secretion also
subsides, and the total insulin level decreases. This leads to
an increase of released free insulin concentration that is
inappropriate for the glucose concentration, resulting in
postabsorptive hypoglycemia [1]. However, most of our
cases had fasting hypoglycemia, which were attributed to
dissociation of insulin and insulin antibodies while the
internal environment changed at night (which may be related
to decreased affinity of the insulin antibody). Insulin
antibodies bind with sufficient insulin in the daytime,
accounting for less antibodies to be attached in the middle
of the night. Therefore, increased free insulin concentrations
could induce fasting hypoglycemia.
In the treatment of non-classical IAS, a suitable dose and
disposition of insulin are required for better glycemic control.
However, while case 3 was in a hypoglycemic status,
the patient was treated with the same insulin and it was
gradually discontinued, and in case 4, the type of insulin
was changed. On the basis of our experience, we prefer to
switch to another type of insulin if islet function appears to
be poor. This is because changing to another insulin type
can make the insulin antibodies disappear and glycemic
concentrations more stable. However, if islet function is
good, we prefer to gradually reduce the same insulin dose
and add oral drugs. Although steroids can aggravate
hyperglycemia, they are always used to treat IAS and
non-classical IAS in clinical practice due to the following reasons.
First, steroids reduce the hypoglycemia phenomenon
that occurs in the middle of the night in non-classical IAS.
Second, steroids decrease insulin antibodies and have advantages
for glycemic control in the daytime. Therefore, we
justify the treatment effectiveness in our patients through stability
of glycemic concentrations.
However, discontinuing previous insulin treatment and
switching to steroid treatment may worsen glucose control
in patients with diabetes mellitus. Therefore, further
studies are required to determine whether a smaller dose
of prednisone in combination with a suitable dose of insulin
can specifically treat non-classical IAS (Table 3).
