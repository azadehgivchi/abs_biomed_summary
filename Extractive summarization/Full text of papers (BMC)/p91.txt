Background
With the popularization of Chinese traditional medicine
(CTM), CTM has begun to be used worldwide. In CTM,
prescriptions are mixtures that contain at least two types
of herbs. Herb-herb interactions or herb-drug interactions
are important factors that affect the pharmacokinetics
and metabolism of drugs and even cause toxicity.
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450s) are a family of
heme-containing proteins that play important roles in
the phaseI metabolism of most clinical drugs in the liver
and intestine. The activities of CYP450s directly affect
the biotransformation and metabolism of various drugs.
For example, puerarin is widely used in the treatment of
cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and it can inhibit
the activity of CYP3A4. Several previous studies demonstrated
that the inhibitory effect of puerarin on the activity
of CYP3A4 resulted in adverse effects on the
pharmacokinetics of various drugs, such as triptolide,
edaravone, and astragaloside IV [1–3].
Cornin is a herb that is extracted from the fruit of Verbena
officinalis L. and is commonly used in cardiology,
which can exert cardioprotective effects [4]. Cornin was
also reported to significantly decrease blood pressure, reverse
cardiac hypertrophy, and improve heart function
[5, 6]. Cornin is always co-administrated with other
drugs to make the treatment more efficient. Previous
studies have mainly focused on the pharmacodynamic
effects of cornin, and whether cornin can affect the metabolism
of co-administered drugs by regulating metabolic
enzymes is still unknown. Therefore, it is urgent to
investigate the interaction between cornin and CYP450s
and determine the effect of cornin on the activities of
CYP450s, such studies could provide guidance for improving
clinical application of herbs.
CYP1A2, 2A6, 3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1 are
major CYP450 isoforms, that are responsible for the metabolism
of most clinical drugs. This study investigated
the effects of cornin on the activities of these CYP450
isoforms in pooled human liver microsomes (HLMs)
with the employment of the enzyme kinetic study that
included probe substrates and reactions.

of HLMs, a corresponding probe substrate and cornin (or
positive inhibitor for different probe reactions) and an
NADPH generating system, including 1mM NADP+, 10
mM glucose-6-phosphate, 1 U/mL of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase, and 4mM MgCl2 was performed with the
final volume of 200 μL. The final microsomal protein concentration,

and concentration of substrates are summarized in
Table 1, according to previous studies [7–9]: phenacetin
O-deethylation for CYP1A2, coumarin 7-hydroxylation
for CYP2A6, testosterone 6β-hydroxylation for CYP3A4,

Except for dextromethorphan and quinidine dissolved
in water, the other probe substrates, positive inhibitors
and cornin were dissolved in 1% (v/v) methanol. The
concentration of cornin was 100 μM and the positive inhibitor
concentrations were summarized in Table 1.
After a pre-incubation of 3 min at 37 °C, an NADPHgenerating
system was added to initiate the reaction.
The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μL
acetonitrile (10% trichloroacetic acid for CYP2A6), and
the solution was placed on ice. After centrifuging at 12,
000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was analyzed by the
HPLC analysis with the employment of Agilent 1260
series instrument with DAD and FLD detector, and the
quantitative assay for the corresponding metabolites was
performed as previously reported [9, 10].
Enzyme inhibition and kinetic studies of cornin
An enzyme inhibition study was performed to investigate
the effect of cornin on the activity of eight CYP
isoform. Then, CYPs of which the activity was affected
by cornin were chosen for the kinetic study with 0–
50 μM cornin and different concentration of probe substrates
(20–100 μM testosterone for CYP3A4, 2–20 μM
diclofenac for CYP2C9 and 25–250 μM chlorzoxazone
for CYP2E1) to obtain the corresponding parameters, including
concentration (IC50) and Ki values.
Time-dependent inhibition study of cornin
The HLMs (1 mg/mL) was pre-incubated with 20 μM
cornin with an NADPH-generating system for 30 min at
37 °C. After the pre-incubation, 20 μL aliquot was incubated
with an NADPH-generating system and probe
substrates with specific concentrations (approximate to
Km) in another incubation tube to evaluate the residual
activity. The corresponding metabolites were analyzed at
0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min of the incubation by HPLC.
A high probe substrate concentration (approximately
4-fold Km values) and various concentrations of cornin
(0–50 μM) were used to obtain the values of the inactivation
constant (KI) and the rate of inactivation (Kinact)
after different preincubation times (0–30 min), with a
two-step incubation scheme, as described above.
Statistical analysis
The least-squares linear regression of the inverse substrate
concentration versus the inverse velocity (Lineweaver-
Burk plots) was used to obtain the enzyme
kinetic parameters, and the mean values were used to
calculate Vmax and Km. Inhibition data from the experiments
that were conducted using multiple compound
concentrations were represented by Dixon plots, and
inhibition constant (Ki) values were calculated using
non-linear regression according to the following
equation:
v ¼ ðVmaxSÞ=ðKmð1 þ I=KiÞ þ SÞ;
where I is the concentration of the compound, Ki is
the inhibition constant, S is the concentration of the
substrate, and Km is the substrate concentration at half
the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction. The
mechanism of the inhibition was inspected using the
Lineweaver-Burk plots and the enzyme inhibition
models. The data comparison was performed using Student’s
t-test and performed using IBM SPSS statistics 20
(SPSS Inc.).
Results
Effects of cornin on the activities of CYP450s
As shown in Fig. 2a, the activities of CYP3A4, 2C9, and
2E1 were significantly inhibited by cornin compared
with the blank control (p < 0.05), while other CYP isoforms
were not affected by cornin (p > 0.001). The residual
activities of CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2E1 in pooled
HLMs were decreased to 13.35, 11.33, and 17.62% after
incubating with 100 μM cornin. The inhibitory effect of
cornin was lower than that of specific inhibitors and the
difference was not significant (p > 0.05).
Then, CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2E1 were incubated with
0–100 μM cornin, and the inhibition of these
CYP450s was found to occur in a dose-dependent
manner with IC50 values of 9.20, 22.91, and 14.28
μΜ, respectively (Fig. 2b).
Model of CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2E1 inhibition by cornin
With the help of Lineweaver-Burk plots of inhibitory
kinetic data, the inhibition of CYP3A4 by cornin was
best fitted in a noncompetitive manner (Fig. 3a). Moreover,
the Ki value was determined to be 4.69 μM according
to the secondary Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 3b).
With the employment of the Lineweaver-Burk plots, the
inhibition of CYP2C9 was found to be competitive
(Fig. 4a), while further secondary fitting analysis obtained
Ki value of CYP2C9 as 11.31 μM (Fig. 4b).
Similarly, the Lineweaver-Burk results showed that cornin
inhibited CYP2E1 in a competitive manner (Fig. 5a),
and the Ki value was 6.54 μM (Fig. 5b).
Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 by cornin
CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2E1 were incubated with 20 μM cornin
for 0–30 min to investigate the effect of incubation
time on the inhibitory effect of cornin. The activity of
CYP3A4 was significantly decreased with incubation
time, but CYP2C9 and 2E1 were not affected (data not
shown). Then, CYP3A4 was incubated with 0–50 μM
cornin for 0–30 min to characterize the time-dependent
inhibition of CYP3A4 by cornin (Fig. 6a). With the help
of nonlinear regression analysis, the value of KI/Kinact
was calculated to be 6.40/0.055 min− 1 μM− 1, indicating
that 5.5% CYP3A4 was further inactivated every minute
in the presence of 6.4 μM cornin (Fig. 6b).
Discussion
Multiple-drug therapy could provide simultaneous treatment
for concurrent diseases and complex chronic disorders,
which leads to its wide application in the clinic
[11, 12]. The co-administration of various drugs leads to
adverse reactions, such as toxicity and treatment failure.
The inhibition or induction of CYP450 activity plays
vital roles in the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of
various drugs during drug-drug interactions [13]. For example,
the co-administration of nobiletin and glycyrrhizin
induced adverse interactions, which resulted in a
decrease of in the plasma concentration of nobiletin due
to the enhancement of CYP3A4 activity by glycyrrhizin
[14]. Cornin is one of the most widely used herbs in cardiology
and exerts the effects of decreasing blood pressure,
reversing cardiac hypertrophy, and improving heart
function [5, 6]. It is essential to investigate the effects of
cornin on the activities of CYP450s.
Here, cornin was incubated with eight major isoforms
of CYP450s in pooled HLMs to determine the effect of
cornin on these CYP450s. It was found that cornin significantly
inhibited the activities of CYP3A4, 2C9, and
2E1, which are responsible for the metabolism of the
vast majority of drugs [13]. CYP3A4 is one of the most
abundant CYP isoforms in the human liver and intestine
and are involved in the metabolism of a large number of
drugs [15, 16]. The vital functional role of CYP3A4 has
been widely shown, and various drug-drug interactions
mediated by CYP3A4 have also been reported. The inhibition
of CYP3A4 by cornin implied a potential interaction
between cornin and drugs metabolized by
CYP3A4. Additionally, the inhibition of CYP3A4 was
achieved in a dose-dependent manner and timedependent
manner. The IC50 value of CYP3A4 is a vital
factor for evaluating the toxicity and clinical risk associated
with cornin and provides guidance for dose of cornin
used in the clinic. In the clinic, care is warranted in
the dosing of CYP3A4 substrates that are coadministrated
with cornin, and dose may be adjusted
with incubation time.
In addition, cornin was also found to competitively inhibit
the activities of CYP2C9 and 2E1, which may be a result of
the similar structures of cornin and CYP2C9 and 2E1 substrates,
such as hydroxyl and aromatic functional groups.
CYP2C9 and 2E1 are involved in the metabolism of a large
number of drugs, thuscontributing to the wide variability in
pharmacokinetics in the metabolism of drugs [17, 18]. For
example, the metabolism of warfarin was inhibited by cannabis
due to the inhibition of CYP2C9 by cannabis [19].
Kaempferia parviflora extract accelerates the metabolism of
acetaminophen by inducing the activity of CYP2E1 [20].
Therefore, the obtained findings also suggested a potential
risk associated with the co-administration of cornin and
drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 and 2E1.
Currently, the application of in silico analysis for
mechanically assessing the interaction between different
drugs and CYP450s has drawn special attention, and this
approach provides future prospects for further studies
[21–24]. Furthermore, this in vitro study revealed the inhibitory
effect of cornin on the activities of CYP3A4,
2C9, and 2E1. The lack of in vivo pharmacokinetic data
on cornin is another limitation of this study, and such
data could help assess the clinical significance of the obtained
IC50 values. The in vivo interaction and potential
drug-drug interaction need to be verified by additional
in vivo experiments.
Conclusion
In vitro findings in this study indicated an inhibitory effect
of cornin on the activities of CYP3A4, 2C9, and
2E1. Cornin was identified as a noncompetitive inhibitor
of CYP3A4 and a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 and
2E1. These results suggested the potential drug-drug
interaction between cornin and CYP3A4, 2C9, and 2E1
substrates in the clinically co-administrated prescriptions,
and these results require further in vivo validation
in future investigations.
