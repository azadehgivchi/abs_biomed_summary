Background
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-
acquired pneumonia (CAP) and a major cause of
meningitis and otitis media. Recent reports show an high
global incidence of macrolide and penicillin resistance,
whereas fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance is not frequent
[1-3]. Current guidelines for suspected bacterial CAP in
patients with co-morbidity factors and recent antibiotic
therapy recommend initial empiric therapy using one respiratory
FQ or one macrolide associated to other drugs
(amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, broad-spectrum
cephalosporins) [4,5].
Resistance to FQ in S. pneumoniae is determined by efflux
mechanisms and/or mutations in the quinolone resistance-
determining regions (QRDRs) of parC and parE
genes coding for topoisomerase IV and/or gyrA and gyrB
genes coding for DNA gyrase [6]. The most frequent resistance
mechanism detected in S. pneumoniae is represented
by associated mutations of both gyrA and parC genes
[1,3,7]. A single parC mutation appears to represent the
first step conferring low-level FQ resistance [6]. A second
mutational step in the gyrA gene produces high-level
resistance to FQ [6]. Both mutations are probably selected
in response to the widespread use of FQ [8,9]. Ciprofloxacin
and levofloxacin use is commonly associated
with parC gene mutations, whereas use of other FQ
appears to favor the selection of mutations in other genes
[6]. Here, we report the first Italian case of CAP in which
failure of levofloxacin treatment was associated to highlevel
FQ resistance in S. pneumoniae.
Case presentation
Microbiological methods
Bacterial identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility
testing (AST) were achieved with the Phoenix System
using SMIC/ID-2 panels (Becton Dickinson
Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD). Specie ID was confirmed
using optochin and bile solubility tests (Taxo Disc,
BBL, Becton Dickinson) [10]. Determinations of minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) were obtained with the
Etest method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller-
Hinton agar with 5% sheep blood (Oxoid, Milano, Italy).
MIC values were interpreted according to current criteria
of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [11].
Amplification of gyrA, gyrB,parC, parE, and pneumolysin
genes were performed by PCR using reported oligonucleotides
[12-14]. Direct DNA sequencing was obtained
using the ABI Prism Big Dye terminator Cycle Sequencing
Kit and the ABI Prism 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). DNA sequences were compared with
sequences present in the GenBank database (gyrA, accession
No. AB010387; gyrB, accession No. Z67740; parE and
parC, accession No. Z67739). Efflux mechanisms were
investigated by broth dilution in Mueller-Hinton medium
containing 5% sheep blood using serial dilution of ciprofloxacin
in the presence or in the absence of 10 mg/L reserpine
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). A fourfold or greater
decrease of the ciprofloxacin MIC in the presence of reserpine
was considered as indicator of efflux mechanisms
[15].
Clinical data and results
In March 2005, a 72-year-old patient with long history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congenital
bullous emphysema, and aortic valve incompetence
developed abrupt-onset fever, cough, increased sputum
production, and dyspnea. Over the past few years, solely
on the basis of clinical data, the patient had received multiple
treatments with oral levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin
for recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTi). At
the onset, the family physician prescribed oral levofloxacin
(500 mg, bid) and paracetamol (500 mg, tid).
Three days later, because of non-remitting fever and acute
respiratory insufficiency, the patient was admitted to the
Emergency Room of the Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione
Macchi (Varese, Italy). On the basis of physical examination
and hypoxemia (pO2 = 45.4 mm Hg) the patient
was intubated. A central venous catheter was implanted.
Blood analysis showed the following results: erythrocytes
4.23 × 106/μL, hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL, hematocrit 38.8%,
platelets 201 × 103/μL, total leukocytes 15.75 × 103/μL
(neutrophils 78.2%, lymphocytes 12.1%), ESR (erythrocyte
sedimentation rate) 86.2 mm/h, CRP (C-reactive protein)
118 mg/L, creatinine 1.02 mg/dL, BUN (blood urea
nitrogen) 26 mg/dL. Chest radiograph showed accentuated
peribronchial interstitium and hilar expansion. Intravenous
corticosteroids and bronchodilators were given.
Twelve hours later, the patient was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where 4 bronchoalveolar lavages
(BAL) were obtained. Levofloxacin was continued by
the i.v. route (500 mg, bid) supplemented with piperacillin/
tazobactam (2.25 g tid). Serial BAL were also obtained
during the first 3 days of hospitalization.
Microbiological tests detected a multidrug-resistant
(MDR) S. pneumoniae isolate (106 colony forming units/
mL) in the four BAL samples obtained at admission. Isolates
had the following MIC values: penicillin G (1 mg/L),
piperacillin (1 mg/L), piperacillin/tazobactam (1 mg/L),
ceftriaxone (0.5 mg/L), cefotaxime (0.5 mg/L), cefepime
(0.5 mg/L), imipenem (0.064 mg/L), erythromycin (>256
mg/L), claritromicyn (>256 mg/L), clindamycin (>256
mg/L mg/L), levofloxacin (>32 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (>32
mg/L), moxifloxacin (>32 mg/L), tetracycline (0.5 mg/L),
chloramphenicol (16 mg/L), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(4 mg/L), rifampin (0.5 mg/L) vancomycin (0.25
mg/L), teicoplanin (0.125 mg/L), linezolid (0.75 mg/L),
and telithromycin (≤0.006 mg/L).
By direct DNA sequencing, point mutations in the gyrA
(Ser81-Phe) and parE (Ile460-Val) genes were detected in
all isolates. Two point mutations of the parC gene (Ser79-
Phe; Lys137-Asn) were also present. No mutations were
detected in the gyrB gene. The reserpine response assay
failed to evidence FQ efflux. The pneumolysin gene was
detected in all isolates.
Prompt clinical response followed the empirical treatment
given at the ICU. On day-two, the patient was afebrile,
hypoxemia resolved (pO2 = 157 mm Hg),
inflammatory markers were decreased (total leukocytes
7.19 × 103/μL, neutrophils 76.1%, lymphocytes 12.0%,
ESR 45 mm/h, CRP 57 mg/L), and blood cultures were
negative. BAL samples obtained on day-2 and at subsequent
times were negative. Five days after hospital admission,
levofloxacin was suspended and piperacillin/
tazobactam was reduced (1.25 g tid). Respiratory assistance
was stopped on day-12. Antibiotic treatment ended
on day-14. Complete recovery ensued and the patient was
discharged on day-16.
Conclusion
The impact of antibiotic resistance on the treatment outcome
of patients with CAP is a matter of discussion [4].
FQ are often the primary choice for empirical treatment of
patients with co-morbidity factors such as COPD, diabetes,
and renal or congestive heart failure [4,5]. A few
reports show an association between FQ resistance and
treatment failure in CAP caused by S. pneumoniae [16,17].
No cases have been yet reported from Italy, possibly due
to the low incidence of FQ-resistant strains [3].
The present report describes the first Italian case of CAP
due to a FQ-resistant strain of S. pneumoniae. Failure of
oral levofloxacin was observed. According to current criteria
[11], the isolate was MDR i.e., intermediate to penicillin,
resistant to chloramphenicol, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole,
macrolides, clindamycin and FQ. The
strain showed single mutations of gyrA and parE genes
associated with two point-mutations of the parC gene.
High-level resistance to FQ resulted (MIC >32 mg/L). This
justified the initial treatment failure when the patient was
given levofloxacin alone. Molecular analysis showed a
group of mutations that have not yet been reported from
Italy [3,18]. Association of the reported mutations in gyrA,
parE and parC genes has been detected only twice in
Europe [3], but is relatively more frequent in the USA [7].
As demonstrated by studies of S. pneumoniae strains
exposed in vitro to FQ, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin use
is commonly associated with parC gene mutations,
whereas use of other FQ appears to favor the selection of
mutations in other genes [6].
The reported clinical case suggests that the following precautions
need to be used for patients with specific LRTi
risk factors: i) before therapy, respiratory samples should
be obtained to identify the responsible agents and to
define antimicrobial susceptibility [16]; ii) patients previously
treated with FQ may be given these drugs, but need
strict clinical monitoring during the first 3 days of therapy
to evaluate the clinical response [19]; iii) since only 1% of
FQ-resistant S. pneumoniae strains are also resistant to
broad-spectrum beta-lactams, seriously ill patients can be
safely treated with combinations of FQ plus broad-spectrum
beta-lactams [20]. Empiric treatment of CAP in
patients seriously compromised using piperacillin/tazobactam
(as in the reported case) appears an effective
means to inhibit FQ-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. In
particular, piperacillin/tazobactam appears indicated for
ICU patients since, in contrast to monotherapy with
extended-spectrum cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone,
cefotaxime), does not favor the selection of ESBL-positive
enterobacteria and/or chromosomal beta-lactamase
hyperproducers (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) [21,22].
Additionally, this drug's spectrum is wider than that of
3rd–4th generation cephalosporins.
In Italy FQ consumption is higher than in the rest of
Europe [8]. Thus, it seems possible that over the next years
an increased prevalence of FQ-resistant S. pneumoniae
strains will be observed. For this reason the detection of a
community-acquired MDR isolate of S. pneumoniae is of
special concern. Emerging resistance traits in this species
underline the need of in vitro tests based on MIC data in
order to select the most appropriate drugs for preventing
the dissemination of epidemic clones.
