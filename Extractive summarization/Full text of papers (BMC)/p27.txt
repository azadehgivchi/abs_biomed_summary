Background
Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a relatively
rare cancer of the urinary tract. UTUC describes a cancer
originating in the renal pelvis, renal calices, and the
ureter. Smoking and aristolochic acid are the two most
common risk factors for UTUC [1, 2]. UTUC has been
genetically linked to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal
cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome,
through mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes [3].
The link between UTUC and bladder cancer has also
been studied, with both cancers being called ‘disparate
twins’ for their similarities in histology and origins yet
differences in diagnosis and treatment [4].
Understanding the epidemiology of UTUC can help
aid clinical diagnosis and can be used to highlight highrisk
groups that can be targeted with strategies to prevent
such groups from developing UTUC [5]. However, whilst
systematic reviews on the epidemiology of other urological
cancers have been performed [6, 7], to our knowledge
a systematic review of the incidence and prevalence of
de-novo UTUC has never been published. The incidence
of UTUC has been estimated at 1–2 cases per 100,000
[8], although this varies between age, geographical
region, occupation, and other factors. This paper aims to
provide a more comprehensive assessment of the global
incidence and prevalence of UTUC in order to support
guidance for future studies on its epidemiology.
Methods
A detailed search strategy (Additional file 1) was developed
using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies
(PRESS) checklist. Three databases were searched
for this systematic review: MEDLINE, Embase, and the
Web of Science Core Collection. No limitations on dates
were applied, and the final search was done on 4th February
2021. This review was registered on PROSPERO
(Registration Number CRD42019134255).
Observational studies (cross-sectional and cohort)
describing the incidence and prevalence of de-novo
UTUC in adults (≥ 18 years of age) were included. Studies
that reported both lower and upper urinary tract
carcinomas were only included if data for UTUC was
separately reported. No further exclusion criteria were
set for study setting and demographic factors. Studies
were excluded if no full text was available, or if the
abstracts were in any other language than English. There
was no language restriction for full texts; translations
were carried out if necessary. The reference lists of the
papers selected were manually searched for further relevant
studies to include in the data extraction.
Results from the database searches were managed in
Mendeley and imported into Rayyan QCRI [9], where
two independent authors (AS and ER) screened the titles
and abstracts. Any remaining conflicts were resolved
by a third author (CB). Both authors (AS and ER) then
screened the full texts of the selected papers for relevance
and bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist
for Prevalence Studies [10]. Any further conflicts were
resolved by a third author (CB).
Data extraction from the selected papers was performed
using the JBI Checklist and managed using
Microsoft Excel. The following data were extracted:
study title, study author(s), year of publication, journal,
country, aim of study, population, setting, study design,
study duration, outcomes measured, diagnostic criteria
used, ethical approval, methods of data analysis,
incidence (and 95% confidence interval), and prevalence
(and 95% confidence interval).
Some papers did not report incidence data in numbers,
instead showing only a graph. The authors of
these studies were contacted for raw data, which are
included in this review. Where raw data was unavailable,
data from graphs in the selected articles were
extracted using WebPlotDigitizer, a software tool that
allows reverse data extraction from both linear and logarithmic
graphs [11].
The data from the selected studies was found to be
heterogeneous and hence a meta-analysis could not be
conducted. Therefore, a narrative synthesis of the data
was done according to the following subgroups: age,
sex, race, geographic region, calendar time, occupation,
Lynch syndrome, and other population characteristics.
Results
The results of the database searches, title and abstract
screening, and full-text screening are outlined in Fig. 1.
The search strategy identified 3506 papers after duplicates
were removed. After title, abstract, and full-text
screening, 117 titles were excluded for a number of
reasons, and 59 papers were included for this review
(Table 1).
The studies selected included data ranging from
the years 1943 to 2018. Europe had the greatest number
of studies (n = 26, 44%), followed by Asia (n = 15,
25%), North America (n = 14, 24%), Australia (three
studies), and one worldwide study. Of the studies from
Europe, 14 (54%) were conducted in the Nordic countries
of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, or Sweden.
Of the studies from Asia, seven (47%) were conducted
in Taiwan. Nearly all studies employed a retrospective
cohort study design except for two studies: Mok et al.
and Aparicio et al., which were prospective cohort
studies [12, 13]. Similarly, nearly all studies focused on
the incidence of UTUC, with only one study by Visser
and colleagues [14] reporting incidence together with
prevalence.
The studies selected for this review included a wide
variety of cancer registries and patient populations.
Eleven studies (19%) used data from the SEER (Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results) registry in the
USA. In total, 38 studies (64%) used International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) codes to identify patients with
a diagnosis of UTUC.
Seven corresponding authors were contacted for the
raw data of graphs in their respective articles, to which
four authors [15–18] replied with this data. In total, eight
papers required data extraction using WebPlotDigitizer
(Additional file 2).
Incidence by age
In total, 12 studies reported incidence of UTUC according
to age [14, 17–28]. The measures used to report
incidence varied widely between different studies. For
example, the study by Visser et al. used rate per million
persons, whereas Cheon and colleagues used rate per
100,000 persons [14, 22]. Other measures used in other
studies include incidence density per 10,000 person-years
and standardised incidence ratios.
Overall, there appeared to be a higher incidence of
UTUC with increasing age. This was seen in both males
and females. Stoyanov and colleagues [19] reported
an incidence of 11.22 per 100,000 persons in male
30–39 year olds, which increased to 17.30 per 100,000
persons in males aged 70 + . In females, the increase
seen in age was higher, from 21.28 to 277.78 per 100,000
persons between 30 and 39 year olds and 70+, respectively.
A similar increasing trend with age was reported
by Visser et al. [14], with an incidence of 1.8 (standard
error [SE] 0.1) per million persons in patients < 55 years
old compared to 73.6 (SE 1.1) per million persons in
75 + year olds.
Incidence by sex
The calculation of age-standardised rates (ASRs) varied
according to what population was used in standardisation.
In the 13 studies that reported on incidence
of UTUC according to sex [14, 19–24, 29–34], the ASR
values were adjusted based on different populations,
including a European population [14], a standard world
population [21], the World Health Organisation (WHO)
standard population [32], the 1995 South Korean population
[22], and population data from the Australian
Bureau of Statistics [34].
The comparative incidence between males and females
was not clear from the studies. Some studies reported
a higher incidence in males than females. For example,
Joung and colleagues [21] reported an ASR of 1.39
(males) vs. 0.49 (females) per 100,000 persons. Others
such as Wang and colleagues [20] reported a higher incidence
in females than males, with a standardised incidence
ratio (SIR) of 15.2 (95% CI 12.7–17.9) for females
vs. 8.1 (95% CI 6.5–10.2) for males.
Incidence by race
Four studies compared incidence between different races
[35–38]. The most comprehensive study was by Mathew
and colleagues [37], who reported worldwide incidence
of UTUC between 1973 and 1992. The study reported
SIR values for, among others, Black Americans, White
Americans, Jewish Israelis, and Chinese Singaporeans.
The highest SIR for renal pelvis cancers in this study was
seen in White Americans (0.79 per 100,000 person-years
for males). Another study by Chow and colleagues [38]
reported a lower ASR in Black American males (0.8 per
100,000 person-years) compared to White American
males (1.5 per 100,000 person-years). This was similarly
seen in Black American females (0.5 per 100,000
person-years) vs. White American females (0.7 per
100,000 person-years).
Another study by Li and colleagues, [36] which covered
an even wider period (1973–2010) but focused on colorectal
cancer survivors, reported a higher SIR of renal
pelvis cancers in Black compared to White Americans
(1.73 [95% CI 0.56–4.04] vs. 1.29 [0.97–1.69], respectively).
The opposite was seen in ureter cancers, with
White Americans having a higher SIR than Black Americans
(1.49 [1.18–1.86] vs. 1.32 [0.16–4.78], respectively).
Incidence by geographical region
Five studies reported on incidence of UTUC according
to specific geographical regions [14, 24, 31, 34, 37]. The
study by Mathew et al. [37] covered 10 regions for both
males and females, and a further five regions for males.
This study used data from the Cancer Incidence in Five
Continents resource and found that the region with the
highest SIR of renal pelvis cancers between 1973 and
1992 was the Bas-Rhin region in eastern France, with an
SIR of 15.5 per 100,000 person-years in males.
Visser et al. [14] further reported incidence in different
regions of Europe between 1995 and 2002 and found
northern Europe to have the highest ASR of 12.8 (SE
0.3) per million persons. The high incidence of UTUC
in regions with a high prevalence of Balkan endemic
nephropathy (BEN) was studied by Medunjanin and colleagues
[31], who reported a high incidence in Croatia
geographically associated with a high prevalence of BEN,
specifically in the Brod-Posavina county.
Differences between regions within countries were
also studied. Hsiao et al. [24] studied UTUC incidence
in Taiwan in patients who had undergone haemodialysis,
finding the highest incidence in southern Taiwan for
both patients who had haemodialysis and those who did
not (38.6 and 1.35 per 10,000 person-years, respectively).
Other regions in Taiwan followed a similar pattern, with
northern Taiwan having the lowest incidence of UTUC
in both groups of patients (11.3 and 0.33 per 10,000
person-years, respectively). In Australia, Antoni et al.
[34] studied the incidence of renal pelvis cancer in five
Australian states and reported the highest ASRs in New
South Wales and Queensland.
Incidence by calendar time
Nineteen studies compared UTUC incidence based on
calendar time [15–18, 22, 25–28, 34, 39–47]. For three
of these studies, more accurate numbers were obtained
by contacting the study authors. The first of these studies
was by Eylert and colleagues [16], who used data from
the National Cancer Data Repository (NCDR) of England
between 1985 and 2009 and found an overall increase
throughout time in UTUC incidence for males, females,
and both sexes combined. Similarly, Kockelbergh and
colleagues [15] studied the National Cancer Registration
and Analysis Service (NCRAS)—which contains
data from the NCDR—from 2001 to 2013 and reported
a similar overall increase in incidence throughout time.
The third study with accurate numbers obtained from the
study authors was by Woodford and colleagues [18], who
studied the Victorian Cancer Registry of Australia from
2001 to 2011 and found the incidence of UTUC to be stable
throughout time.
Other studies that showed a decreased incidence
over time include the study by Antoni et al. [34], which
reported a reduction in incidence in all five cancer registries
in Australia that were studied from 1983–1987 to
2003–2007. The study by Wang et al. [42], which used
data from the National Health Insurance Research Database
in Taiwan and focused on patients with end-stage
renal disease under maintenance dialysis, reported a
reduced SIR40-
84 of UTUC in males from 1998 (13.0 [95%
CI 6.2–27.3]) to 2008 (9.5 [7.3–12.3]), but an increased
SIR40-
84 in females from 1998 (9.5 [7.3–12.3]) to 2008
(13.6 [11.4–16.4]).
Incidence by occupation
Seven studies reported on UTUC incidence according
to occupation [24, 27, 48–52]. Five of these studies were
based on the national cancer registries and censuses of
Nordic countries [27, 48, 50–52]. A total of 54 occupational
categories are included in the comprehensive study
by Michalek and colleagues [27] on five Nordic countries
(Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden)
between 1961 and 2005. The occupation categories with
the highest SIR were seamen (1.51 [95% CI 1.23–1.82]),
printers (1.39 [1.11–1.71]), and welders (1.37 [1.03–
1.78]). The study further classified occupations according
to age at diagnosis, and the highest SIR was observed
in seamen aged 30–49 years old (1.75 [0.96–2.94]).
Michalek et al. published another study [52] using smoking
prevalence data to adjust for smoking in males when
reporting UTUC incidence. This study found the highest
statistically significant smoking-adjusted SIR to be in
physicians (1.63 [1.16–2.23]).
The study by Pukkala and colleagues [48] on the same
five Nordic countries between 1943–1990 reported a
similarly high SIR in seamen of 1.52 (1.26–1.85), while
the highest SIR in women was seen in clerical workers
(1.19 [1.08–1.31]). Moreover, McLaughlin et al. [50]
reported SIR of renal pelvis cancers in 34 different occupations
between 1960 and 1979 in Sweden, with the highest
incidence found to be in judges (9.16), engineers and
technicians in mining and metallurgy (3.29), and plumbers
(2.17).
Incidence by Lynch syndrome
Our search of the literature found only one epidemiological
study on the incidence of UTUC in patients
with Lynch syndrome. Many studies were excluded that
focused instead on the incidence of Lynch syndrome in
patients with UTUC, with other studies investigating the
risks and survival rates of these patients.
The study by Ericson and colleagues [53] set out to
assess cancer risk in patients whose parents developed
any tumour associated with Lynch syndrome. The study
used data from the Swedish Cancer Registry between
1961 and 1999. Patients were categorised according to
familial risk groups, as well as the type of malignancy
present in the parent. The overall SIR of UTUC in all
patients was 1.2 (95% CI 0.9–1.5). The highest incidence
of UTUC was seen in patients whose parent and
sibling had an HNPCC-associated cancer, one of whom
was under 50 years old when diagnosed—the SIR in this
group was 29.6 (8.1–75.9).
Incidence by other population characteristics
A number of studies included in this review reported
an increased UTUC incidence in different populations
and patient groups. For example, Sun et al. [54] studied
patients with a recent urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis
and found a higher incidence of UTUC in patients
who had an upper UTI (1.38 per 10,000 person-years)
compared to those who had a lower UTI (1.12) and no
UTI (0.27). Another study by Chow et al. [23] to assess
whether UTUC is linked to kidney and ureter stones
reported a higher SIR of UTUC in patients who had a
UTI at their index visit (6.7 [95% CI 2.4–14.5]) compared
to those who did not (2.2 [1.6–3.0]).
Prospective cohort studies
There were only two prospective cohort studies included
in this review. Mok et al. [12] reported a higher incidence
of ureter cancer in patients with a low estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) of < 45 (13.7 per 10,000 personyears)
compared to patients with a higher eGFR of ≥ 90
(0.3). The second study by Aparicio et al. [13] was a multicentre
study of 31 institutions in Spain utilising a centralised
database to report cases of UTUC prospectively.
This study reported a relatively high incidence rate of
3.27 (95% CI 2.93–3.61) per 100,000 person-years, which
the authors conclude is due to the prospective nature of
their study.
Prevalence
The only study to report on prevalence values for UTUC
included in this review was by Visser et al. [14], which
used the RARECARE database of rare cancers in Europe.
However, estimated complete prevalence was only
available for the index year 2003, and data was only used
from 22 registries in 12 countries as representative of the
EU27 countries. In total, the estimated complete prevalence
for epithelial tumours of the renal pelvis and ureter
was 101.0 (SE 1.5) per million persons. This was nearly
double that of epithelial tumours of the penis, which was
the next most prevalent cancer at 55.4 (SE 1.1) per million
persons. The most common subtype of UTUC was
transitional cell carcinoma at 93.2 (SE 1.4) per million
persons, followed by adenocarcinoma at 1.4 (SE 0.2) per
million persons, then squamous cell carcinoma (prevalence
not reported).
Discussion
Data from the 59 papers included in this review highlight
a number of trends in the epidemiology of UTUC. Overall,
there is an increase in incidence with age and specific
occupations such as seamen and printers. The trend in
incidence seen in other factors—sex, race, geographical
region, and calendar time—was less clear. Single studies
reported a high incidence of UTUC in patients with
a history of an upper UTI, and patients with a low eGFR.
Prevalence of UTUC was only reported by one study,
which showed UTUC to be the most common of the rare
urogenital cancers. Similarly, only one study reported the
incidence of UTUC in patients with Lynch syndrome,
and although this was limited to data obtained only from
the Swedish Cancer Registry, it included data from a
period of 40 years.
The general increase in UTUC incidence across time
reported by some studies can be attributed to the introduction
of computed tomography (CT) urography in
the detection of UTUC [15]. CT urography is a recent
introduction in the diagnosis of UTUC, which for many
decades was dominated by intravenous urography. Several
guidelines have only recently changed to reflect the
higher diagnostic accuracy provided by CT urography,
which is now the first-line imaging modality for investigating
UTUC [55].
The relatively high incidence of UTUC reported in
seamen has been proposed to be due to increased exposure
to asbestos fibres in ships [27]. The association
between occupational exposure and other urological
cancers has been studied, with a high incidence of bladder
cancer in seamen reported in a study on the Nordic
Occupational Cancer cohort [56]. Exposure to other
chemicals, such as the azo dyes used in the printing
and dyeing industry, have also been linked to increased
bladder cancer incidence [57]. This could explain the
increased UTUC incidence observed in printers in the
study reported by Michalek et al. [27]. A further aspect
of occupational exposure was proposed by Michalek
et al. [52] in their study of smoking-adjusted incidence,
Incidence by Lynch syndrome

The relatively high incidence of UTUC reported in

to asbestos fibres in ships [27]. The association
between occupational exposure and other urological
cancers has been studied, with a high incidence of bladder
cancer in seamen reported in a study on the Nordic
Occupational Cancer cohort [56]. Exposure to other
chemicals, such as the azo dyes used in the printing
and dyeing industry, have also been linked to increased
bladder cancer incidence [57]. This could explain the
increased UTUC incidence observed in printers in the
study reported by Michalek et al. [27]. A further aspect
of occupational exposure was proposed by Michalek
et al. [52] in their study of smoking-adjusted incidence,
with the suggestion that exposure to phenacetin and
X-rays/gamma rays could be the cause of a statistically
significant high smoking-adjusted SIR in physicians,
although this was also suggested to be due to surveillance
bias and increased awareness of urothelial cancer
symptoms by physicians.
The studies that reported values on race generally
found a mixed picture in the incidence of UTUC between
Black and White Americans. Mathew et al. and Chow
et al. reported a higher SIR for renal pelvis cancers in
White Americans compared to Black Americans [37, 38].
Racial disparities between Black and White Americans
have been studied and have been found to exist in other
urological cancers [58, 59]. The reason for this disparity
is difficult to quantify, as it could be attributed to genetics,
lifestyle factors such as smoking, or poorer access to
healthcare.
Studies based in Taiwan report a relatively high incidence
of UTUC due to the widespread consumption of
aristolochic acid, an established risk factor for UTUC.
This carcinogenic and nephrotoxic agent, which was
banned in Taiwan in 2003, is present in herbal medicines
and has been linked to an increased risk of urinary
tract cancers [60]. Exploring the effect of the ban of
aristolochic acid on UTUC incidence, Wang et al. [42]
reported a decrease in the SIR40-
84 in both males and
females after the introduction of the ban, although the
authors note that there remains another carcinogenic and
nephrotoxic agent (Xi-Xin) similar to aristolochic acid in
circulation in Taiwan that requires further study.
The SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results) Program is a database that collects data on cancer
incidence in the USA and is a common tool used in
epidemiological studies of cancer [61]. However, many
excluded studies from this review considered the SEER
category of ‘kidney and renal pelvis’ cancers as cancers
of the renal pelvis. Kidney and renal pelvis cancers are
not alike as they originate from different tissues and are
histologically different, namely, renal cell carcinoma and
urothelial carcinoma. This is reflected in the different
ICD-10 codes assigned to each cancer: C64 (Malignant
neoplasm of kidney, except renal pelvis), C65 (Malignant
neoplasm of renal pelvis), and C66 (Malignant neoplasm
of ureter) [62].
Similarly, many of the studies excluded from this
review cite the comprehensive study by Siegel and colleagues
[63], but this paper has the same limitation as
above in that renal pelvis cancers are grouped together
with kidney cancers. Moreover, studies that mention a
high incidence of UTUC in endemic areas of blackfoot
disease do not report UTUC separately, instead grouping
UTUC with other urinary cancers. Future studies
reporting on renal pelvis cancers should ensure that
there is a clear delineation between these two types of
cancers with a different aetiology and histology.
Full-text screening identified only one study [14]
reporting on the prevalence of UTUC that met our
inclusion criteria. While data on the incidence of
UTUC is useful in identifying trends, the lack of prevalence
studies on UTUC needs to be addressed in order
to provide a better picture of the burden of UTUC in
different populations.
A notable limitation that was identified through the use
of the JBI checklist was that many studies did not report
the 95% confidence intervals of their incidence values.
Furthermore, the JBI checklist also highlighted that many
papers in our review did not mention ethical approval,
which should be required even if the study design is
observational, as databases with personally identifiable
information may be used during the study. Future epidemiological
studies should ensure that appropriate ethical
approval is obtained before commencing the study.
A limitation of this review is that the data from the
studies selected was found to be heterogeneous, and
hence a qualitative synthesis of the data was done in
place of a meta-analysis to reflect the nature of the data.
Future studies on the epidemiology of UTUC should
consider reporting incidence data using similar metrics
(such as those for age standardisation) in order to allow
for a more accurate quantitative comparison.
Conclusion
Although UTUC is a relatively rare urological cancer, it
is still an important public health concern in many areas
and patient populations around the world. The present
review highlights an increased incidence of UTUC seen
in certain groups, including increasing age and certain
occupations such as seamen. UTUC is more endemic in
certain geographical regions of the world where there
are associated risk factors. The trend of UTUC incidence
for sex, race, and calendar time is less clear due to a wide
variety of measures used to report incidence. There is
also sparse literature on the prevalence of UTUC, and
further studies using this important epidemiological metric
are needed to know the true disease burden of UTUC.
The results of this review provide epidemiologists, public
health specialists, and clinicians a better understanding
of the epidemiology of UTUC in order to guide diagnosis
and prevention.
