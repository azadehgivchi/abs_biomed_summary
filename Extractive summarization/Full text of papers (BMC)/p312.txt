Background
Injuries are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide [1]. According to the Global Burden of Disease
(GBD) study, 973 million individuals suffer from injuries
that require medical attention, and around 4.8 million die
every year [2]. Childhood injuries are of particular concern.
In 2011, more than 630,000 children died because
of injuries [3]. In the United States, unintentional injuries
were the leading cause of death in 2019 [4]. According to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
the leading cause of death from unintentional injuries
was MVC followed by drowning, burns, and suffocation,
whereas unintentional fall remains the most common
cause for nonfatal injuries.
The burden of injuries is not limited to preventable
deaths. Millions of children require hospitalization,
and some endure lifelong disabilities that could negatively
affect their stages of development. According to a
report by the World Health Organization (WHO), loss
of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) worldwide is
predicted to be primarily caused by MVC by 2030 [5].
Around 16.6% of loss DALYs among children in Saudi
Arabia are due to injuries and of which 8.1% are due to
MVC [6].
Injuries are not random events, but they are often associated
with predictable factors. Age is associated with a
higher risk of serious injury [7]. A previous systematic
review suggested a bimodal distribution peaking at the
two opposite age extremities [7]. Teenagers between 15
to 19 have an increased risk due to increased exposure to
hazards and risk-taking behaviours. On the other hand,
young infants are also at a high risk of injuries [7]. Gender
also plays a role in the risk of fatal and nonfatal injuries
among children [7]. Although males are at a higher
risk for mortality due to all types of injury, the male to
female ratio varies by the cause of injury. For example,
motorcycle crashes, falls, and firearm-related deaths are
ten times higher among males, while pedestrian-related
deaths are only slightly greater among males [7, 8].
Child injuries are a public health concern for both
high-income and low-income countries but more pronounced
in countries undergoing extreme urbanization
and industrialization [9, 10]. However, the risk of injuryrelated
deaths is higher among low- and middle-income
than high-income countries [11]. Children of low- and
middle-income countries are exposed to more hostile
environments; open fires, unstable construction sites,
unprotected stairways, absence of safe play space, and
lack of safe storage of chemicals [12]. Poverty is a risk factor
for unintentional injuries even within high-income
countries [13].
In Saudi Arabia, two injuries were ranked among
the ten leading causes of death: transport injuries and
unintentional injuries, according to the GBD [14]. The
majority of preventable deaths in Saudi children (82.5%)
were attributed to injuries [15]. The leading cause
for injury mortality was MVC at 60.6% and was most
commonly found among 13-18-year-olds, followed by
drowning at 13.4% and most commonly found among
6-12-year-olds [15].
Approximately 31% of the Saudi population are children
and adolescents [14]. Therefore, the consequences
of injuries will have direct effects on population health.
Despite that, limited and fragmented exploration of the
burden of childhood injuries may negatively impact prevention.
Further understanding of the epidemiology
of child injuries will facilitate efforts in prevention and
guide future research to understand the magnitude of
the problem. Therefore, we aim in this review to describe
the magnitude of childhood injuries, including the most
common types and causes across gender and age groups
in Saudi Arabia.
Methods
Search strategy and study selection:
A literature search was performed in January 2021
using Scopus, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for any
study published in English between January 2000 and
December 2020. We used search limits for source type,
document type, year, language, country, and age. The
search strategy for each database is detailed in Supplementary
file 1. Additional records were identified from
reference lists of selected articles, Saudi digital library,
and search engines. One reviewer (H.A) reviewed titles
and abstracts to assess relevance and collected relevant
titles and abstracts for full text assessment. Deduplication
was performed using Microsoft Excel. Full text
manuscripts were reviewed and evaluated against the
eligibility criteria.
Eligibility criteria
The databases were searched from April to May 2021 to
identify articles published between January 1st, 2000,
to December 31st, 2020. The timeframe was chosen
because medical documentation and research in Saudi
Arabia became mature only in the last two decades.
The steps we followed for study selection are shown in
(Fig. 1). To be included in this review, a study had to
meet the following criteria:
1) Children (between 0 to 18 years of age.).
2) The publication date is between 2000 and 2020.
3) Published in English.
4) Contain epidemiological data such as age and gender.
5) Focused on injuries including drowning, fall, trauma,
fracture, burn, MVC, poisoning, and suffocation.
Exclusion criteria were:
1)Reviews, case studies, or abstracts.
2)Sample size of fewer than 50 children.
Type of studies
The type of studies included was retrospective and prospective
cohorts in addition to cross-sectional studies.
Data extraction and synthesis
The primary outcome was the type and the cause of
childhood injuries and their distribution among age
groups, gender, and regions. The number of children,
year of publication, study timeframe, study type, region,
age, gender, type and cause of injury, and mortality rate
were recorded by one reviewer (H.A). No authors have
been contacted to obtain any additional data. After
reviewing the literature, studies were categorized based
on the type of injury into six categories: overall injuries,
fractures, burns, MVC injuries, oral injuries, and poisoning.
Weighted percentages were calculated for gender,
causes, and mechanism of injury in addition to the
reported overall mortality rate in each category.
Quality assessment
The quality of studies was assessed by two independent
reviewers (HA and NA) using the Strengthening
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) statement [16]. The STROBE checklist
includes 22 items distributed as 1 for abstract, 2 for introduction,
9 for the methods, 5 for the results, and 4 for
the discussion, and 1 for funding. Disagreements were
resolved by consensus.
Results
The initial search identified 3,384 studies. After screening
titles and abstracts, 3,330 publications were excluded
for being irrelevant or duplicates. The full text of 54 studies
was assessed for eligibility, where 18 did not meet the
inclusion criteria and were excluded. Thirty-six studies
have met the inclusion criteria and were included in this
scoping review (Fig. 1). In total, 20,136 participants were
included. Of the total population, 13,890 were males
(69%), and 5,596 were females (27.8%), while gender was
not reported for 650 children (3.2%). Twenty-one studies
were conducted in the central region - Riyadh, which
accounts for the majority (58%) of the studies. As for
the remaining studies, five were conducted in the eastern
region, four, three, and one were conducted in the
western region, Southern region, and Northern region,
respectively. Two studies were conducted in several
regions of the country.
Of the included publications, eleven studies explored
overall injuries. Five studies focused on fractures, five on
burns, four on MVC injuries, four on oral injuries, and
seven examined poisoning. A visual summary of some of
the studies’ findings is presented in Fig. 2. Based on the
STROBE checklist, the quality of studies ranged from
5 to 19, with the majority scores being between 13 and
16 (Supplementary file 2). The most common missing
items were the explanation of the study size, variables,
handling quantitative variables, controlling for bias, and
generalizability.
Overall injuries
Eleven thousand six hundred seventy-five participants
were included in the overall injuries’ category (Table 1)
[17–27]. Most injured children were males (74.6%). In
fact, gender was found to be a significant predictor of
unintentional injuries, falls and MVC with higher odds
for males (OR: 2.59, OR: 1.76, OR: 2.17, respectively, P
< 0.01) [17, 26]. According to a household survey conducted
among 1,650 participants, 22% of children sustained
an injury in the past year [17]. A more recent
study with a smaller sample (n=283) suggested that the
prevalence of unintentional childhood injuries was 24.7%
in the past 12 months [26]. The weighted percentage of
falls accounted for 31.9% of overall injuries, followed by
MVC representing 25.1%. Head injuries were most likely
to be associated with MVC followed by falls [18]. Furthermore,
blunt injuries caused by falls and MVC were
the leading cause of deaths in overall injuries [21]. Additionally,
MVC was reported to be the primary cause of
injury that led to an extended length of stay [22]. In fact,
the mechanism of injury was found to be a significant
predictor of extended length of stay with higher odds
for MVC and burns (OR: 16.2, OR: 14.5, respectively, P <
0.001) as opposed to falls [22].
Another critical childhood injury was drowning.
A study showed that males represented 66.7% of the
drowning incidents. Among this population, drowning
led to brain death (4%), and 2% of victims sustained
severe neurological damage [23]. The study, which was
conducted in the eastern region, reported that most cases
occurred in the sea (74.5%) at night (56.9%) with no lifeguard
present (92.2%).
Fingertip injuries were identified as one mechanism
and were significantly higher among males (59.5%) compared
to females [19]. These injuries were commonly
caused by house doors and more prevalent among children
younger than five years. Overall, the mortality rate
for overall injuries was only reported in five studies.
Among those studies, the weighted mortality rate was
5.2%, whereas the highest mortality rate (14.7%) was
reported in head injuries [18].
Fractures
Fracture injuries studies included 865 participants
(Table 2) [28–32]. The majority of reported fractures
occurred among males (72.8%). The ratio of male to
female was 2.68:1. The leading cause of fracture injuries
was falling at home (37.9%), followed by MVC (21.5%).
Other causes for fractures included door slams, direct
hits, and pedestrian injuries. Fractures occurred mainly
among older children as close half of children were
between 13-18 of age [30]. At the same time, epidural
hematoma was more likely to occur among children
between 5-14 years of age than other children [29, 31].
On the other hand, nonaccidental fractures were more
common in preschoolers, followed by infants [32]. The
mortality rate was reported in two studies conducted on
spine fractures and epidural hematoma, both with a rate
of 8.3% [29, 31].
Burns
Burn studies included 1,380 children (Table 3) [33–37].
Of those, 58% were males. The extent of burns was minor
in most cases (less than 20% of Total Body Surface Area
(TBSA)). The most common cause for burns was flames
(52.1%), followed by scald (36.4%). Two studies showed
that most burns (60%) occurred among toddlers and preschoolers
[33, 34]. About half of the victims admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were between 5-10 years of
age [36]. Four studies have reported mortality rates; the
weighted percentage of mortality was 17.4%, where the
highest rate (25.3%) occurred among those admitted to
the ICU.
MVC
One thousand two hundred twelve children were
included in the MVC studies (Table 4) [38–41]. Overall,
males represented the majority (71%) of injured victims.
One study showed that most injuries (71%) were
sustained by pedestrians, followed by passengers (27%)
[38]. Front seated children accounted for 46% of the
cases with a higher rate of isolated head, neck, or facial
injuries than back seated children (51.2% vs. 25%, P =
0.01) [39]. On the other hand, children seated in the
back had higher rates of rollover (52.1% vs 24.4%, P =
0.02), ejection (41.7% vs 22%, P = 0.05), and occupant
death ratio (14.8% vs 4%, P = 0.04) and were more likely
to have long bone or pelvic fractures (60.4% vs 36.6%,
P = 0.02) [39]. Moreover, a study showed that 38.3%
of children injured in MVC sustained head injuries,
whereas facial injuries were sustained by 34.8% of children
[41]. According to that study, 2.4% lost their lives
due to the MVC. More than half of injured children
(53.8%) were back seated without seatbelts or car seats,
while 9.1% were driving [41].
Oral and dental trauma
The number of patients included in oral and dental
trauma studies was 2,454 (Table 5) [42–45]. There was
a comparable proportion of males to females [43, 44].
While the other two were conducted solely in males [42,
45]. Falls were the most common cause of dental injuries
(62.7%) [43, 44]. More than one-third (39.5%) of middle
school boys sustained oral injuries, while only half have
received dental treatment [45]. The same study showed
high family income to be associated with a lower likelihood
of dental trauma (OR=0.44, P < 0.05) [45].
Poisoning and toxicological exposure
Studies on childhood poisoning and toxicological exposure
included 2,550 children (Table 6) [46–52]. Most
of the accidental poisoning occurred among children
younger than three years. Further, age was found to be
a significant predictor of hospital admission (OR: 1.19,
P < 0.05) [48]. The male-female ratio was comparable
(1.17:1). The most common mechanism was ingestion
with drugs associated with 39.9% of the cases, followed
by toxic household products (25.7%). One study
reported that no action was taken by parents (90.2%)
following the incidents [47]. A study conducted in several
regions of the kingdom reported a 3.1% mortality
rate [51].
Discussion
This scoping review suggests that falls and MVC are the
leading causes of injuries in the kingdom. Similarly, a
global study conducted in low-and middle-income countries
found fall and MVC to be the most common mechanism
of childhood injuries [53].
Many MVC injuries are preventable using evidencebased
safety measures such as seatbelts, car seats, or
helmets. However, they remain a neglected focus in the
kingdom. In this respect, a study conducted in 2018 to
assess the use of child restraint systems found that only
one-third of the families reported having child restraint
systems while only half of them were consistently using
them [54]. Additionally, more than half of the families
reported setting children on the passenger’s lap [54].
Therefore, further investment in public health interventions
to reduce falls and MVC is warranted to reduce
their burden on population health.
Our findings show that males represented most overall
injuries, fractures, burns, MVC, and dental trauma.
These results are consistent with the public data obtained
from the CDC, stating that males accounted for 58.4% of
unintentional injuries that occurred between 2001 and
2019 in the United States [55]. Likewise, in low- and middle-
income countries, male children were more susceptible
to injuries than females [53]. This gender disparity
can be attributed to the greater risk-taking tendency in
males [56]. Thus, gender-specific prevention strategies
may help reduce the burden of associated injuries [57].
Although the mortality rate was relatively low, it may
reflect the underlying resources for capturing injury data.
However, the rate was exceptionally high among more
critical cases such as ICU burns (25.3%) and head injuries
(14.7%), followed by fractures (8.3%). Correspondingly,
a study on childhood mortality in the eastern region
showed that half of the deaths (51%) were attributed to
accidents, with male children representing 69% of the
cases [58]. In addition, the autopsy has revealed that head
injury was the leading cause of death (27%) among the
autopsied cases [58]. These are high rates, and national
actions need to be undertaken to reduce them.
Primary prevention of injuries provides the best value
and return on the outcome. The Child Safety Action
Plan (CSAP) in European Union serves as an excellent
example for tackling mortality resulting from childhood
injuries [59]. This policy was first developed through
assessing the situation with government engagement,
followed by setting a vision, goals, and objectives, and
finally implementing the best evidence-based practices
that the government endorsed.
Our findings have some policy and public health implications,
namely supporting the Saudi 2030 vision [60].
One of the pillars of this Vision is to extend life expectancy
from 74 to 80 and improve quality of life. Our research
describes the magnitude of the problem and highlights
the need for intersectoral interventions. As the Vision
focuses on preventing health risks, preventive interventions
of childhood injuries, namely fall, and MVC need to
be implemented. One of the Vision’s objectives is to promote
traffic safety which could potentially aid in MVC
prevention. Another implication is highlighting the need
for investing in secondary prevention by dealing with
injuries once they occur to reduce their consequences. A
recent cross-sectional study found a low level of awareness
about first aid to childhood injuries such as burns,
drowning, and choking among 39% of Saudi parents [61].
However, most parents (78%) were willing to take a first
aid class. This reinforces the need to implement sustainable
awareness-raising strategies at the family level.
This is the first scoping review of the epidemiology
of childhood injuries in Saudi Arabia to the best of our
knowledge. However, we acknowledge that our review
has several limitations. First, the lack of socioeconomic
data may not reflect the variation of the prevalence and
the mechanisms of injuries. Second, we were also unable
to capture and generalize the age groups due to the missing
continuous data and the inconsistency in age group
classification across the studies. Third, most studies were
retrospective chart review studies which can be more
susceptible to bias. There is a significant need for population-
based and longitudinal studies to provide more substantial
evidence of the burden of injuries on population
health of the kingdom. Fourth, except for one study, the
primary focus of the included publications was unintentional
injuries, which emphasizes the need to extend the
current research in Saudi Arabia to nonaccidental childhood
injuries. Finally, there was a substantial difference
in publication rates across the regions of Saudi Arabia as
more than half of the included studies were conducted in
the central region-Riyadh, which affects the generalizability
of our findings. This can be attributed to the presence
of highly equipped trauma centers and research institutions
in the region. Clearly, there is a disparity in our ability
to capture the true burden in other regions accurately.
Therefore, it is crucial to conduct further studies on the
prevalence and magnitude of childhood injuries across all
regions of Saudi Arabia while maintaining a high-quality
research and reporting practices.
Conclusions
This review found that the leading causes and mechanisms
of childhood injuries were falls and MVC. Unfortunately,
all types of injuries resulted in substantial mortality
rates, and there is a definite need for national action to
be undertaken to reduce them. Overall, further research
should be carried out to capture the determinants of
childhood injuries across all regions of Saudi Arabia
