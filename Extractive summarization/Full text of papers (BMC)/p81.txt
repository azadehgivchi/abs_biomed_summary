Background
According to the statistical results of the World Health 
Organization, coronary artery diseases such as acute cor-
onary syndrome (ACS) have become some of the most 
frequent causes of death worldwide [1]. ACS includes 
acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 
(STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarc-
tion (NSTEMI), and unstable angina pectoris (UA) [2]. 
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains the 
most effective treatment for ACS [3, 4]. However, the 
incidence of MACE in patients with different risk factors 
varies, especially in high-risk cases [5, 6]. A predictive 
model would allow physicians to better identify patients 
at elevated risk, which would facilitate a more personal-
ized approach to managing these cases.
Several cardiovascular disease risk and progno-
sis assessment tools have been established in different 
populations to guide clinical practice [7–14]. GRACE 
and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk 
scores are recommended in the guidelines for predict-
ing cardiovascular outcomes (short- and medium-term) 
for patients with ACS [7, 15–17]. The CADILLAC risk 
score is used to predict 30-day and 1-year mortality after 
PCI for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [8]. Unfortu-
nately, clinical risk stratification for long-term MACEs 
for patients with ACS after PCI is not well defined.
In recent years, an increasing number of studies have 
focused on laboratory testing indicators to predict the 
prognosis of diseases. Several recent studies have shown 
that lactate level is an independent prognostic factor that 
is useful for identifying patients at high risk [18–21]. Our 
purpose in designing a nomogram incorporating lac-
tate was to provide a tool for the clinical evaluation of 
patients with ACS undergoing PCI.
Methods
Patient selection
The prospective study was approved by the Ethics Com-
mittee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medi-
cal University. All study subjects provided informed 
consent. From January 2013 to July 2019, a total of 2465 
patients in the Cardiovascular Department of the First 
Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University were 
diagnosed with ACS and underwent PCI.
ACS is diagnosed according to current American Heart 
Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology 
(ACC) guidelines, including STEMI and non-ST-segment 
elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) [22, 
23]. STEMI was defined as continuous chest pain that 
lasted > 30 min, arrival at the hospital within 12 h from 
the onset of symptoms, ST-segment elevation > 0.1  mV 
in ≥ 2 contiguous leads or new left bundle-branch block 
on the 12-lead electrocardiogram, and elevated cardiac 
markers (creatine kinase-MB or troponin I) [22]. NSTE-
ACS included NSTEMI and UA. NSTEMI was defined 
as ischemic symptoms in the absence of ST-segment 
elevation on the electrocardiogram with elevated cardiac 
markers. UA was defined as having newly developed/
accelerating chest symptoms on exertion or rest angina 
within 2  weeks without biomarker release [23]. The 
exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) chronic coronary 
syndrome; (2) tumour history; (3) significant comorbid-
ity, trauma, or surgery; (4) incomplete follow-up data; 
and (5) death within the first month.
According to these inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
1986 patients were included in the study. Patients fol-
lowed for 4 years were randomly divided into the train-
ing (n = 1324) and validation sets (n = 662) based on 
a computer-generated randomly generated allocation 
sequence. All methods were carried out in accordance 
with approved guidelines.
Clinical outcomes definitions
MACE was defined as the end point of this study and 
refers to all-cause mortality, clinically driven re-vascular-
ization of target lesions, and new or recurrent myocardial 
infarction and stroke.
Collection of demographic, clinical, and follow‑up data
All data were extracted from the electronic medical 
record system. Demographic data included sex and age. 
The preoperative clinical indicators included left ante-
rior descending branch (LAD) stenosis ≥ 50%, left cir-
cumflex artery (LCX) stenosis ≥ 50%, right coronary 
artery (RCA) stenosis ≥ 50% (according to TIMI criteria 
[16]), three-vessel disease (LAD, LCX and RCA all with 
stenosis ≥ 50%), serum lactate level, serum brain natriu-
retic peptide (BNP) level, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (EGFR), serum creatinine level, haemoglobin (HB), 
serum uric acid level, and left ventricular ejection frac-
tion (LVEF). Blood samples were drawn from peripheral 
venous blood immediately upon admission and tested at 
the hospital’s central laboratory. The maximum values of 
lactate and BNP were taken before coronary angiography. 
EGFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation [24]. 
LVEF was obtained by echocardiography measured in 
2D-biplane at hospital admission (before PCI) [25, 26]. 
Medical history included hypertension, diabetes, periph-
eral artery stenosis, atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, 
and kidney disease. Stenosis of the LAD, LCX and RCA 
was determined by coronary angiography during hospi-
talization. Killip class I was defined as the absence of con-
gestive heart failure, class II as the presence of rales and/
or jugular venous distention, class III as the presence of 
pulmonary oedema, and class IV as cardiogenic shock.
Regular medical follow-up data were obtained by tel-
ephone and clinic visits. Patients in the training set and 
the validation set were followed up for four years.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables with a normal distribution are 
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation ( x ± s), and 
Student’s t-tests were used to compare the differences 
 
between the training and validation sets. The nonnor-
mally distributed data are described as the median and 
25th and 75th percentiles, and comparisons of the two 
sets were carried out with the Mann–Whitney U‐test. 
Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies (pro-
portions), and descriptive comparisons were made 
using Pearson’s χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test if one of the 
expected values in the 2 × 2 table was < 5. Differences in 
the event rates at different time points after PCI were 
assessed using the χ2 test. The associations of these vari-
ables with MACEs were identified using Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models. Forward stepwise 
selection (likelihood ratio) with the Akaike information 
criterion (AIC) was used to select variables for the mul-
tivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. 
The results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). The identified variables based 
on the results of multivariate analysis were incorporated 
to construct the nomogram to predict the risk of MACEs 
at 6 months, 1 year and 4 years after PCI using statisti-
cal software (rms in R, version 3.6.2; http:// www.r- proje 
ct. org). With the input of independent risk factors, the 
nomogram outputs a risk score for each patient.
The area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC) of the time‐dependent receiver operating 
characteristic curve (tdROC) varies as a function of time 
[27]. TdROC was estimated for comparing the discrimi-
nation (predictive capability) of the nomogram, CADIL-
LAC risk score and GRACE risk score [28]. The accuracy 
of calibration was assessed by plotting the nomogram-
predicted and observed MACE rates based on the popu-
lation quartiles of predicted risk. In addition, we analysed 
the potency of this model to stratify patients at high risk 
for MACEs.
All data management and statistical analysis were per-
formed using SPSS 20.0, MedCalc 19.0.5 and R 3.6.2. 
X-tile 3.6.1 was used to obtain cut-off values [29]. All 
tests were performed 2‐tailed at a significance level of 5%.

Results
Baseline characteristics of patients and outcomes
A total of 1986 patients with ACS treated with PCI were 
included in this study after excluding those with missing 
data. The training set comprised 1324 patients, with 662 
patients in the validation set. The baseline characteris-
tics of the patients in the training and validation sets are 
shown in Table 1. The baseline characteristics were simi-
lar between the two sets, except for sex. The percentage 
of males in the training set was higher than that of the 
validation set (81.3% vs. 76.4%, P = 0.012).
During follow-up, MACE occurred in 201 (15.1%) 
cases in the training data set but not in 1123 cases. For 
the training set, after 6 months, 1 year and 4 years, the 
MACE rates were 3.1%, 3.8% and 14.0%, respectively. For 
the validation set, MACE occurred in 96 (14.5%) cases 
but not in 566. The MACE rates in the validation set 
6 months, 1 year and 4 years later were 3.9%, 4.1% and 
13.4%, respectively. The χ2 test showed no significant dif-
ferences between the two groups (P > 0.05) (Table 1).
Development of the multivariate prognostic nomogram
According to the univariate Cox regression analysis, 
15 candidate clinical variables were found to meet the 
threshold of P < 0.05 (Table  2). The multivariate Cox 
regression analysis indicated that age, LAD stenosis, 
RCA stenosis, lactate, BNP and LVEF were significant 
independent predictors of the MACE rate in the training 
set (P < 0.05). These predictors were used to construct the 
prediction model (Fig.  1). Each predictor corresponded 
to a specific point by drawing the straight line upwards to 
the point axis. Scores for each variable were summed and 
located on the “Total Points” axis. Finally, a vertical line 
was drawn straight down from the plotted total point axis 
to the probability axis to locate the likelihood of MACE.
Assessment of the nomogram’s performance
In the training set, the 6-month area under the ROC 
curve (AUC) was 0.712 (95% CI 0.621–0.803) for the 
model, the 1-year AUC was 0.741 (95% CI 0.665–0.817), 
and the 4-year AUC was 0.762 (95% CI 0.692–0.831), 
indicating excellent discrimination (Table 2). The calibra-
tion of predictions from the model was satisfactory, as 
assessed by comparison of prediction by nomogram to 
the actual MACE rate across quartiles of risk, as shown 
in Fig. 2a–c.
Validation of the nomogram
In the validation set, the AUC at 6  months was 0.811 
(95% CI 0.730–0.891), the 1-year AUC was 0.818 (95% 
CI 0.739, 0.897), and the 4-year AUC was 0.724 (95% 
CI 0.631–0.816) (Table 3). The favourable calibration of 
the nomogram was also confirmed in the validation set 
(Fig. 2d–f).
Comparing the performance of the newly developed risk 
score with existing risk scores
In the training and validation sets, we compared the 
tdROCs of the nomogram with the CADILLAC score 
and GRACE score. The results showed that the discrimi-
nation of the nomogram was most favourable (Table 3; 
Fig. 3).

Performance of the prognostic nomogram in stratifying 
risk
In the training set with an endpoint time of 4 years, the 
total prognostic scores calculated by the nomogram were 
categorized into two risk groups to predict MACE: ‘low-
risk’ (score ≤ 285.1) and ‘high-risk’ (score > 285.1) based 
on the cut-off value calculated using X-tile software [28] 
(Fig. 4).
The Kaplan–Meier curves for both sets clearly showed 
that the nomogram was stable in differentiating between 
high-risk and low-risk patients (Fig. 5). The HR for the 
‘high-risk’ category was found to be 4.11 (95% CI 3.08–
5.49) compared to the ‘low-risk’ category in the training 
set and 4.01 (95% CI 2.68–6.00) in the validation set.
Discussion
Our results confirmed that several demographic and 
clinical characteristics reported from previous mod-
els developed from other databases can be used to con-
struct a simple model for prognostic evaluation. The 6 
most important factors—lactate level, age, LAD stenosis, 
RCA stenosis, BNP level, and LVEF—contained most of 
the prognostic information and were incorporated into 
the nomogram. To our knowledge, this nomogram is the 
first clinical prediction model incorporating lactate for 
predicting the long-term risk of MACEs among patients 
with ACS after PCI. Nomograms are evidence-based and 
fully personalized tools to guide clinical decision-making 
and provide patient-friendly, accurate and repeatable 
predictions without the need for computer software to 
interpret [30]. Risk stratification is important in deter-
mining which medications and revascularization should 
be used. In addition, the prediction contributes to the 
development of health care and clinical guidelines for 
ACS.
Lactate, as an easily and quickly assessed metabolite, 
has been studied over time in acute cardiac patients 
to evaluate its prognostic ability [19]. A meta-analysis 
showed a greater reduction in lactate concentrations 
in survivors than in non-survivors, whether follow-
ing cardiac surgery, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest 
[31]. Harjola et al. found that lactate level (> 2 mmol/L) 
was independently associated with increased short-
term mortality for patients with cardiogenic shock 
[32]. For patients with STEMI, higher lactate levels 
were independently associated with 30-day mortal-
ity and overall adverse reactions to PCI (in particular, 
lactate ≥ 1.8  mmol/L) [33]. Marashly et  al. found that 
for patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to acute 
coronary syndrome, lactate ≥ 2.5  mmol/L could inde-
pendently predict 30-day all-cause mortality and then 
established an ACS-MCS score [34]. Ruling out cardio-
genic shock, in 766 patients with STEMI and NSTEMI 
undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, lactate was a 
predictor of 30-day and late mortality [35]. In addition, 
in a study of 1865 patients with ACS, elevated lactate 
levels (≥ 1.8  mmol/L) at admission were an independ-
ent predictor of 30-day and 180-day all-cause mortal-
ity [18]. Lactate is an important fuel for the stressed 
heart and is produced by the dehydrogenation of pyru-
vate, which is synthesized from glycolysis [36, 37]. In a

lactate, BNP, and LVEF. The score for each value was assigned by drawing a line upward to the points line, and the sum of the six scores was plotted 
on the total points line. Finally, the probability line was used to determine the probability of MACE

normal heart at rest, β-oxidation of fatty acids provides 
approximately 60–90% of energy, while pyruvate pro-
duces 10–40% [38]. During exercise, the uptake and 
use of lactate in the myocardium increases, as does 
the stimulation of β-adrenergic stimulation and shock 
[39]. Hyperlactatemia can be seen as part of the stress 
response, including increased metabolic rate, sympa-
thetic nervous system activation, accelerated glycolysis, 
and improved bioenergy supply [19]. Hyperlactate after 
ACS may be caused by hypoxia following haemodynamic 
disorders or by catecholamine-induced aerobic glyco-
lysis in response to stress [39, 40]. These studies suggest 
that lactate may play an important role in the course of 
ACS. To the best of our knowledge, however, there has 
been no risk prediction tool for MACEs integrating lac-
tate to date. Therefore, a well-performed risk prediction 
model incorporating lactate is urgently needed. It must 
be acknowledged that certain drugs (e.g., metformin, 
sodium bicarbonate), preoperatively sustained fasting 
periods with volume depletion, and even hypertension 
could have contributed to changes in lactate levels, which 
could interfere with this evaluation [35]. Unfortunately, 
we did not calculate lactate clearance, which has been 
reported to be more reliable on clinical grounds than lac-
tate for risk stratification in different critical illness con-
ditions [41–43].
For the other five variables, TIMI risk score indicated 
prior coronary stenosis of 50% or more as an independ-
ent predictor for the primary end point (all-cause mor-
tality, MI, or urgent revascularization) occurred by 
14 days [16]. In a study of 6755 patients after PCI, Iqbal 
et  al. found that for patients with multivessel disease, 
untreated proximal LAD and RCA (stenosis > 70%) w ere 
associated with increased mortality [44]. BNP level was 
a strong independent predictor of short-term postop-
erative mortality [45]. Grabowski et  al. improved their 
model’s predictive power by adding BNP to the Killip 
class and TIMI flow grades [46]. A possible explanation 
is that an elevated BNP level reflects a larger infarct size 
and progressive left ventricular remodelling, thus more

obviously reflecting the degree of cardiac insufficiency 
[47]. Similar to BNP, LVEF also serves as a reference 
index for cardiac function to supply important prognos-
tic information and should be included in approaches for 
stratifying risk after myocardial infarction [48, 49] Many 
studies have reported that age is a significant risk factor 
for clinical events (cardiac death, target vessel myocar-
dial infarction, and clinically driven target vessel revas-
cularization) after PCI [50, 51]. The predictive ability of 
simple age cut-off points of 65 and 75 are similar to that 
of a more complex model with age as a continuous vari-
able [16]. To overcome or avoid the limitations of a single 
predictor and achieve high prediction accuracy, we com-
bined six detected predictors into this model. Because of 
dynamic variations, the nomogram did not include clini-
cal symptoms and signs, such as Killip class, heart rate, 
and systolic blood pressure, which are significantly asso-
ciated with ACS mortality [7, 8, 14, 16]; Killip class may 
result in information bias by the judgement error of the 
clinician’s supervisor. Nomograms are easy to recall and 
clinically useful.
The model had adequate discrimination and calibra-
tion power in the training set (AUC = 0.712–0.762) to 
predict MACEs and appeared statistically robust in that 
it was validated in a separate third of the participants 
(AUC = 0.724–0.818). Discrimination for MACE predic-
tion of the nomogram was superior to GRACE risk score 
and CADILLAC risk score in both sets, confirming that 
nomogram was more valuable in predicting MACEs, 
especially in the long term. The TIMI risk score, pub-
lished in 2000, predicted the primary end point (all-cause 
mortality, MI, or severe recurrent ischaemia requiring 
urgent revascularization) through 14  days after rand-
omization for UA/NSTEMI [52]. The GRACE risk score 
has been established to predict the risk of death during 
hospitalization and at 6  months for patients with ACS 
[7]. To predict 30-day and 1-year mortality risk after PCI 
for AMI, the PAMI risk score and CADILLAC risk score 
were established successively [8, 14]. Several studies have 
proven that in predicting 30-day and 1-year mortality, 
the CADILLAC risk score showed slight superiority over 
GRACE, TIMI, and PAMI risk scores [53–55]. The prob-
able reason is that the CADILLAC risk score emphasizes 
the importance of LVEF and three-vessel disease [54]. 
Our nomogram also incorporated these variables. Their 
predictors, such as heart rate, systolic blood pressure, 
myocardial enzymes and creatinine, are dynamic. Killip 
class, postprocedural TIMI flow grade, and ST-segment 
deviation require the judgement of professional physi-
cians. In addition, previous risk models were derived 
from Western populations, which limited their applica-
tion to other populations. In addition, few of the partici-
pants were followed up for more than one year.
In regard to the clinical application of the nomogram, 
we have taken an example of a case of 75 years old (75 
points), LAD stenosis 50% (78 points), RCA stenosis 10% 
(0 point), lactate 1 mmol/L (0 point), BNP 100 pg/ml (0 
point) and LVEF 38% (57 points). The total score was 210, 
and the expected MACE rates after 6 months, 1 year and 
4 years were 2%, 3% and 30%, respectively. Patients with 
ACS undergoing PCI can be thus classified into high- and 
low-risk groups for 4-year MACEs.
The most attractive aspect features of these models 
are their accuracy, generalizability, and ease of use. The 
nomogram is an excellent model to span the entire spec-
trum of ACS. It is based on a relatively unselected group 
of patients, representing patients seen in general clinical 
practice. It includes a new variable, lactate level, that is

[score < 285.1))

stable and easily accessible. In addition, the nomogram 
has an excellent ability to discriminate risk. In the past, 
risk scores were mostly based on Western populations, 
while the population of patients with ACS after PCI in 
the East, especially in China, was much larger, requiring 
a specialized prediction model. The nomogram uses the 
latest clinical data from the past 7 years to reflect the cur-
rent cardiovascular medical level. Although ACS can be 
treated in many ways, our study evaluated patient out-
comes solely treated with PCI, with fewer uncontrolled 
variables and more stable clinical events. Unlike tradi-
tional risk scores, a follow-up period of up to 4 years is 
conducive to the evaluation of long-term prognosis.
Limitations also existed in this study. Although lac-
tate has certain predictive ability, the detection time and 
collection method of lactate are not unified and clear. 
Some clinical drugs may cause changes in lactate with-
out improving the prognosis. Besides, the role of lactate 
may not be consistent in a general cohort of ACS patients 
including STEMI, NSTEMI and UA. Since it clearly indi-
cates those patients with hemodinamic compromise and 
more probably STEMI patients. Subgroup analyses of 
STEMI, NSTEMI and UA were not performed for lack 
of adequate detailed information of all patients, result-
ing in the prediction performance of the model in this 
three cohorts not being estimated separately. A multi-
center validation study, particularly involving other eth-
nic groups, is required to confirm the performance of the 
nomogram before clinical application.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel prognostic nomogram incorpo-
rating lactate level and five other easily available and 
objective variables can serve as an accurate and favour-
able prognostic prediction of 6-month, 1-year, and 4-year 
incidence of MACEs among patients with the entire 
spectrum of ACS after PCI. This information can help cli-
nicians stratify risk for optimal triage and management.
