Background
Pulse pressure (PP) refers to the difference between sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure, of which the normal 
range is 30–50 mmHg [1]. As an independent risk factor 
of cardiovascular disease, PP is attracting more attention 
from doctors, and its forecast value may be larger than 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP) [2]. Hypertension and cardiocerebrovascular dis-
eases caused by vascular diseases are often accompanied 
by elevated PP [3–5]. Therefore, a comprehensive under-
standing of the molecular basis of high PP is crucial for 
the development of potential therapeutic strategies.
The decrease in vascular elasticity is an important fac-
tor for the increase in pulse differential pressure and 
may result from inflammation and vascular endothelial

cell dysfunction. Many novel loci related to blood pres-
sure (BP) adjustment have been identified by researchers. 
However, it is suggested that there is a possible pres-
ence of allelic heterogeneity in BP regulation between 
Europeans and Asians, which provide new mechanistic 
insights into cardiovascular disease [6]. A previous study 
has reported that BRD4 and PIN1 are involved in inflam-
mation and vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. As a 
transcription regulatory factor, BRD4 may lead to extra-
cellular calcium deposition, and BRD4 may cooperate 
with seven specific transcription factors to promote calci-
fication [7]. BRD4 silencing results in a significant reduc-
tion in inflammatory cytokine expression [8]. Multiple 
studies have shown that PIN1 binds to endothelial nitric 
oxide (NO) synthase and enables dephosphorylation of 
serine, which increases NO production and endothe-
lium-dependent dilation, leading to BP maintenance [9]. 
Inhibiting Brd4 and Pin1 expression alleviates enhancer-
mediated inflammatory transcription and atherosclero-
sis, which indicates that BRD4 and PIN1 play a vital role 
in the development of vascular inflammation and athero-
sclerosis [10–13]. Therefore, it is possible that variants 
in BRD4 and PIN1 genes may lead to decreased vascu-
lar elasticity by destroying endothelial cells and causing 
atherosclerosis.
The aim of this study was to investigate the association 
between BRD4 and PIN1 gene polymorphisms and high 
PP in a Chinese population.
Methods
Subjects
Han Chinese who visited the Fujian Medical University 
Affiliated with the First Hospital (from September 2014 
to December 2016) were potential study subjects for 
this research. Patients with renal failure, severe heart 
disease (e.g. myocardial infarction, congenital heart dis-
ease, serious arrhythmia, valvulopathy or other athero-
sclerotic lesions), gestation, severe psychiatric disorder, 
cancer, peripheral vascular disease, severe anemia, severe 
metabolic disease, or infectious disease were excluded. 
Therefore, 232 healthy control subjects (SBP < 140  mm 
Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg) who were not taking antihy-
pertensive medication and 666 hypertensive patients 
(SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg) were selected 
for the study. Also, BP was measured three times using 
a calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer by certified 
examiners with at least 10  min interval and taken the 
average of three readings. The difference between sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure is PP. The aims of the 
study were carefully explained to all participants, who 
signed an informed written consent. The project com-
plied with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and was 
approved by the Institute’s Human Research and Ethics 
Committees.
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection 
and genotyping
SNPs associated with risk factors for high pulse differen-
tial pressure and their minor allele frequencies are greater 
than 5% in the 1000 Genomes Project (https ://www.inter 
natio nalge nome.org/). We used DNA isolation kits (Tai-
jing Biological Technology [Xiamen], China) to extract 
genomic DNA from blood samples collected in antico-
agulant ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid(EDTA) tubes 
and stored at − 20 °C. Five SNPs (rs4808278, rs2233678, 
rs2233679, rs2287838, and rs2233682) were genotyped 
using the polymerase chain reaction ligase detection 
reaction (PCR-LDR) method with five TaqMan genotyp-
ing assays on a Light Cycler 480 Instrument (Roche Diag-
nostics, Basel, Switzerland). Taqman probes and primers 
for the BRD4 and PIN1 genes were synthesized by Shang-
hai Generay Biotech (see Additional file 2: Table  S1, in 
the online version of this article). PCR amplification was 
carried out in a PTC-200  MJ Research Peltier Thermal 
Cycler (Bio-Rad Lab, Massachusetts, USA). Genotyping 
of the five examined SNPs was performed as previously 
described [14].
Statistical analysis
SPSS v.25.0 was used for statistical analyses. Means and 
standard deviations (SDs) were calculated for normally 
distributed continuous variables, and percentages were 
calculated for categorical variables. The Student’s t-test 
was used to compare normally distributed numeric vari-
ables between two groups, otherwise a non-parametric 
test was used. SHESIS software (https ://www.nhgg.org/
analy sis/) was used to calculate Hardy–Weinberg equilib-
rium (HWE), genotype/allele frequencies, and haplotype 
analysis [15, 16]. To evaluate the association between 
SNPs and high PP, logistic regression analysis was used 
to examine the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs). Generalized multifactor dimensionality 
reduction (GMDR) was used to detect gene–gene and 
gene-environment interactions. P values reported were 
two-tailed and those less than 0.05 were considered sta-
tistically significant. The analysis results were also pro-
cessed using an online calculator for false discovery rate 
(FDR) 
correction 
(https ://www.sdmpr oject .com/utili 
ties/?show=FDR).
Results
Clinical characteristics of the study population
We recorded baseline characteristics including anthro-
pometric index and clinical biomarkers between patients 
with high (243 males, 217 females) and normal (275 

 
males, 163 females) PP. As shown in Table 1, there was no 
statistical difference in weight (P > 0.05) between the two 
groups. In addition, cases and controls were comparable 
with respect to height, drinking, and smoking (P < 0.05). 
Older subjects with higher levels of body mass index 
(BMI), waist circumference, SBP, DBP, obesity, diabetes, 
and smoking had a high risk of high PP (P < 0.001).
Associations between BRD4 and PIN1 SNPs and high PP
Of the five SNPs in BRD4 and PIN1 analyzed in this 
study, one SNP (rs2233679) was excluded because of 
significant deviation from HWE (P < 0.05), whereas the 
other SNPs satisfied the HWE in the control groups. 
Allele frequencies and basic information for all SNPs are 
shown in Table 2 and Additional file 1. The frequency of 
rs4808278 genotypes (P = 0.046878) was significantly dif-
ferent between normal PP and high PP groups. No sig-
nificant difference was found in the genotype distribution 
of rs2233678, rs2233682, and rs2287838 between the two 
groups.
Three risk prediction models (additive model, domi-
nant model, and recessive model) were used to evalu-
ate the association between these gene polymorphisms 
and high PP risk. The data show that rs4808278 is 
markedly associated with high PP under the additive 
and recessive models. The adjusted P value was further 
increased after adjusting for age, weight, waist circum-
ference, drinking, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. 
As a result, carriers of the rs4808278-A allele have a 
higher risk of developing high PP compared those car-
rying the rs4808278-TT genotype after adjustment 
for confounding factors (OR = 0.400; 95% CI: 0.217–
0.737; P = 0.003). No significance was observed for the 
remaining polymorphisms under all models (see Addi-
tional file 2: Table S2).
Haplotype analyses of BRD4 and PIN1 SNPs
SHESIS software was used to perform haplotype analy-
ses. Compared to the control group, no significant dif-
ference was found in haplotypes of the PIN1 gene in the 
case group (see Additional file 2: Table S3).
GMDR analysis of BRD4 and PIN1 SNPs and high PP risk
The GMDR model was used to investigate the best 
interaction combination among the four SNPs and 
smoking on high PP risk. Table  3 summarizes the 
results obtained from GMDR analysis for gene–gene 
and gene-diabetes interactions. The best three-locus 
models for gene-diabetes interaction (P = 0.0107) were 
rs4808278, rs2287838, and diabetes after adjusting for 
the covariates (age, sex, smoking, drinking and BMI), 
of which the cross-validation consistency was 9/10. 
However, we did not find a significant any-locus model 
among the four SNPs.

Mapping of associated SNPs at expression quantitative 
trait loci (eQTLs)
Rs4808278 was annotated using the RegulomeDB, a 
database that identifies DNA features and regulatory 
elements in non-coding regions of the human genome. 
Known and predicted regulatory DNA elements 
include DNase hypersensitivity regions, transcription 
factor (TF) binding sites, and promoter regions that 
have been biochemically characterized to regulate tran-
scription [17]. Therefore, we investigated the function 
of rs4808278 in gene expression regulation by exploring 
the RegulomeDB. The RegulomeDB score of rs4808278 
in BRD4 was 4, suggesting that rs4808278 may be part 
of a TF binding site or DNase hypersensitive region.
Discussion
Scholars are paying more attention to heredity as an 
important factor in high pulse differential pressure [18, 
19]. To investigate a potential association between five 
promising polymorphisms in the BRD4 and PIN1 genes 
and high PP risk in a southeastern Chinese population, 
we designed this pilot case–control study that includes 
666 hypertensive patients and 232 normotensive sub-
jects according to exclusion and inclusion criteria. After 
excluding one SNP (rs2233679) that was not in HWE, 
we analyzed the remaining four SNPs. There was no sta-
tistically significant correlation between the four SNPs 
and hypertension risk, but we unexpectedly found that 
rs4808278 in BRD4 was associated with high PP risk,

suggesting that BRD4 may play an important role in high 
PP progression. This discovery may provide a new thera-
peutic target gene.
BRD4, a member of the bromo and extra-terminal fam-
ily, plays a role in various vascular pathologies. Knocking 
down Brd4 with siRNA mitigates neointima formation 
and vascular remodeling [20, 21]. The protein also regu-
lates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced 
angiogenesis by activating phosphorylation of vascu-
lar endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and 
P21 activated kinase 1 (PAK1) [22, 23]. To some extent, 
these pathologies are related to changes in vascular 
elasticity, which may affect PP variation. Through bind-
ing with acetylated RelA, BRD4 enhances activation of 
NF-κB signaling to induce natriuretic peptide precursor 
A (NPPA) and natriuretic peptide precursor B (NPPB) 
transcription [24]. Our previous research also found 
that a SNP in the NPPB gene is associated with high PP 
[14]. BRD4 plays a critical role in propagating inflam-
mation and promoting vascular calcification in particu-
lar [7, 8]. More importantly, BRD4, a transcriptional 
regulator, mediates inflammatory transcription, ath-
erogenic endothelial response, and atherosclerosis [10, 
11]. Vascular damage, an antecedent to atherosclerosis, 
leads to an increase in PP and to atherosclerosis, which 
in turn results in large-vessel stiffening and increased 
wave reflection. While it is not clear what is the incipi-
ent event in this cycle, it is clear that, once initiated, a 
vicious cycle promoting disease progression ensues. The 
association analysis of PP with different genotypes show 
that rs4808278 genotype TT carriers have a lower risk 
than AT and AA genotypes carriers to have higher PP 
(OR = 0.405; 95% CI: 0.220–0.745; P = 0.004), which indi-
cates that the T allele has a protective effect. Although 
rs4808278 is located in an intron of BRD4, the Regu-
lomeDB score of rs4808278 in BRD4 is 4, which suggests 
that rs4808278 may be part of a TF binding site or DNase 
hypersensitive region. This suggests that rs4808278 may 
affect PP by regulating BRD4 expression. Few studies 
have reported on SNPs in BRD4 and high PP. Our results 
may provide new research directions on high PP.
High PP, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis are 
closely related, and PP is considered an independent pre-
dictor of new-onset diabetes [25, 26]. Therefore, diabetes 
and the four SNPs were included in the GMDR analysis. 
We found a significant three-locus model (P = 0.0010) 
involving rs4808278, rs2233678, and diabetes after 
adjusting the covariates. The detailed mechanism under-
lying this interaction is unknown, but all of them are 
associated with vascular elasticity, which may be the 
basis for high PP.
There are several limitations in the present work. 
Firstly, only five SNPs were studied. Secondly, this is a 
retrospective case–control study. Our original inten-
tion was to look for the relationship between SNPs in 
BRD4/PIN1 and hypertension, but we did not find any 
association. Thirdly, the presence of atherosclerosis, 
an important factor causing an increase in PP, was not 
recorded in the patients.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our results indicate that genetic muta-
tions within the BRD4 gene (rs4808278) could affect 
the susceptibility to high PP in a southeastern Chinese 
population.
