Over 3 million adults in the United States are visually
impaired or blind, and up to 80 million have eye diseases
that may ultimately lead to blindness [1]. Furthermore,
the annual economic impact of blindness is estimated to
be over 35 billion dollars [2]. As the population ages, the
number of Americans with blindness is expected to
double by the year 2030 [1]. As such, an increasing number
of patients with blindness will be hospitalized; hospital
providers of all disciplines will invariably become
progressively more involved in their care. Unfortunately,
few studies have sought to screen for and consider poor
vision during hospitalizations when visual disturbances
are not related to the chief reason for admission [3].
While it has been established that vision impairment is
associated with inpatient complications outcomes, such
as falls and delirium [4, 5], no US based national study
has investigated in-hospital mortality in patients with severe
vision impairment or blindness (SVI/B). Morse determined
that older Medicare recipients with severe vision loss utilized
more healthcare resources compared to those without
this disability [6]. However, the impact of SVI/B on a
broader age range of patient has not been studied on a national
level. We used the National Inpatient Sample (NIS)
database for the year 2017, and hypothesized that hospitalized
patients with SVI/B would have higher in-hospital
mortality, less likely to be discharged home following
hospitalization, have longer hospital stays, and greater hospital
charges compared to those without SVI/B.
Given the worsening obesity pandemic with worldwide
prevalence tripling from 1975 to 2016 [7] (and continuing
to increase in prevalence in the United States from 39 % to
2016 to 42 % in 2017 [8, 9]) and the uncertain effect it was
having on patients admitted who had SVI/B, a subgroup
analysis was also carried out to investigate the additive impact
of obesity on these same outcome variables. In fact, research
has shown positive associations between obesity and
development of debilitating eye conditions such as cataracts,
retinal vein occlusion, and age-related macular degeneration
[10]. Thus, determining overall SVI/B prevalence
and outcomes in hospitalized patients may better highlight
its pervasiveness and ultimate deleterious consequences.
This in turn may increase obesity eye disease awareness
and possibly even obesity interventional strategies initiated
or continued among ophthalmologists (such as weight loss
counsel, weight loss referrals and patient education on vision
loss as consequence of obesity).
Methods
Setting / database
This study used the 2017 NIS database, available
through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
provided by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
[11]. NIS is the largest United States based publicly
available all-payer inpatient health care database [11]. It
approximates a 20 % stratified sample of US hospital discharges
from 46 participating states. The NIS has data
for more than 7 million unweighted hospital stays per
year. When weighted to represent all admissions, it estimates
more than 35 million hospitalizations annually,
and represents about 95 % of US hospitalizations. Strata
include hospital size/volume, teaching status, geographic
region, and hospital ownership. Data from 2017 NIS
uses the International Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) coding system
for all discharge diagnoses.
Study population, patient and hospital characteristics,
and o utcomes
All patients ≥ 18 years of age were included in the sample.
We then identified selected patients with bilateral
severe visual impairment or bilateral blindness as described
by their ICD-10 CM codes (eye category 2
through 5 for either eye): https://www.icd10monitor.
com/looking-at-new-icd-10-cm-codes-for-blindness (updated
September 27th 2017). In addition, ICD-10 code
H54.0 was also used for bilateral blindness. Supplementary
Table A with ICD-10 codes provides specific descriptions
of categories for each level of SVI/B. Severe
vision impairment has been defined as individuals with
visual acuity worse than 6/60, and blindness as those
with visual acuity worse than 3/60 [12].
ICD-10 codes used for our subgroup analysis to study
the impact of obesity as a secondary diagnosis on patients
with SVL/B was also retrieved (See Supplementary
A table for ICD-10 codes and corresponding diagnoses).
For adults, obesity is defined as having a Body Mass
Index (BMI) of 30 or greater [13]. BMI is calculated by
taking the individual’s weight in kilograms and dividing
it by their height in meters squared.
Data was collected and adjusted for select hospital and
patient characteristics including hospital bed size (capacity),
hospital teaching status (teaching or non-teaching),
hospital geographic region (Northeastern, Midwestern,
Southern and Western regions), age, gender (male and female
only), race (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific
Islander), insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, Private Insurance,
Uninsured), median household income (1. $1-$38,
999 2. $39,000-$47,999 3. $48,000-$62,999 4. $63,000 or
more), based on home zip code, and the Charlson comorbidity
index (CCI: score 0 = no comorbidities score 1 =
low comorbidity burden, score 2 = moderate comorbidity
burden, and score 3 or greater = high comorbidity burden).
The CCI has been used extensively in clinical research;
it is commonly used to assess mortality risk and it
is supported by extensive validity evidence [14]. Higher
scores have been associated with mortality or greater
healthcare resource use [15].
The primary clinical outcome was mortality during
hospitalization; secondary outcomes were total hospital
charges which represent the amount a hospital bills for
each individual case [16], length of stay (LOS), and disposition
after hospitalization. Disposition indicates the discharge
location or where patients go after hospitalization.
This is most often home, but not infrequently can be elsewhere
including venues such as other hospitals, inpatient
hospice, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, and nursing
homes [17].
Our Institutional Review Board designated this work
as being exempt from detailed review (IRB review number:
00257552).
Statistical analyses
Comparisons were examined between patients with and
without SVI/B using Pearson’s χ2 tests and one-way
analysis of variance to test categorical and continuous
variables. Analyses were also carried out within the SVI/
B patient cohort assessing those with and without obesity.
The primary and secondary outcomes were adjusted
for all of the patient demographics and hospital characteristics
shown in Table 1, as well as the CCI and select
specific comorbidities described in Table 2.
Adjusted odds ratios [aOR] and adjusted mean differences
[aMD] from multivariate logistic and linear regression
analyses were obtained. Binary outcomes under
logistic regression analyses (in-hospital mortality and
discharge disposition) were studied. Linear regression
was used to study continuous outcome variables (including
total hospital charges and LOS). Stata 15.0 statistical
software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) was used and
permitted us to account for design complexity (stratification,
weighting, and clustering) [18]. The p-values for
this study were 2 sided and type I error significance level
was set at 0.05.
Results
In 2017, 35,769,613 adults ≥ 18 years of age were hospitalized
in the United States. From this group, 37,200 patients
were severely visually impaired or blind. Demographic
data is shown in Table 1 and compares patients with and
without SVI/B. Patients with SVI/B were older (mean
age ± SEM: 66.4 ± 0.24 vs. 57.9 ± 0.09 years, p < 0.01), less
likely to be female (50 % vs. 57.7 %, p < 0.01), and a higher
proportion were insured by Medicare (75.7 % vs. 49.2 %,
p < 0.01). Table 2 displays that patients with SVI/B had a
greater comorbidity burden (Charlson comorbidity score ≥
3: 53.2 % vs. 27.8 %, p < 0.01), as well as higher rates of
vascular and pulmonary comorbidities.
Patient clinical and resource utilization outcomes
Table 3 shows adult patients with SVI/B had higher rates
of mortality compared to those without SVI/B (3.9 % vs.
2.2 %; p < 0.01). This finding held after adjusting for potential
confounders where in-hospital mortality for patients
with SVI/B remained higher compared to those
without SVI/B (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.2, [Confidence
Interval (CI) 1.0-1.4]; p = 0.01). Patients with SVI/
B had a lower odds to be discharged to home after hospital
discharge (adjusted Odds Ratio {aOR} =0.54, [Confidence
Interval (CI) 0.51–0.58]; p < 0.01). Total hospital
charges were not significantly different (adjusted Mean
Difference {aMD} = $247 CI [-$2,474-2,929]; p = 0.85)
between groups, but LOS was longer (aMD = 0.5 days CI
[0.3–0.7]; p < 0.01) for those with SVI/B.
Subgroup analysis focused on obesity
Among patients with SVI/B, 32,201 (86.5 %) were not
obese and 4,999 (13.5 %) were classified as obese. Patients
with obesity were younger (mean age ± SEM: 61.5 ± 0.53
vs. 67.2 ± 0.27 years, p < 0.01) and a higher proportion
were female (58.8 % vs. 48.6 %, p < 0.01). Patients with
obesity had higher comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity
scores ≥ 3: 65.0 % vs. 51.8 %, p < 0.01). Table 4 shows that
obese status was not associated with an altered LOS, odds
of mortality, or likelihood of being discharged to home
following the hospitalization. However, SVI/B patients
with obesity had higher total hospital charges compared
to those without obesity (mean difference: $9,821 [CI $1,
375-$18,268]; p = 0.02).
Discussion
Millions of Americans have vision impairment or are
blind [1, 19]. As rates continue to climb with the aging
of the population [1], inpatient providers will encounter
more patients with SVI/B and they will be expected to
effectively manage this vulnerable population. This study
shows that compared to those without SVI/B, patients
with SVI/B who are hospitalized have higher mortality
rates, longer LOS, and are more likely to be discharged
to sites other than home. Moreover, among patients with
SVI/B, those who were obese had higher total hospital
charges than their non-obese counterparts, and as the
obesity epidemic continues to soar, more patients with
SVI/B who are obese can be expected to be hospitalized.
A 2013 study that secured data from a regional registry
in Western Australia discovered that legally blind
hospitalized adults had a seven times higher mortality
rate compared to those with normal vision [20]. In a
longitudinal study from 2002 to 2013 using the Korean
National Health Insurance database, Choi also found
that those with blindness (> 1200 individuals) also had a
higher mortality than patients with normal sight [21].
These results held in distinct analyses assessing both
older (> 60 years of age) and younger (< 60 years) patients
[21] suggesting that the associations were independent
of age. While Crewe or Choi investigated
hospitalized patients with blindness, neither study included
hospitalized patients with severe vision impairment
as was done in our study. In 2013, the World
Health Organization (WHO) launched a global action
plan for universal eye health with specific guidance for
caring for those with SVI/B [22]. These efforts were
intended to heighten awareness and escalate the reporting
of vision loss in hopes of modifying clinical practice.
The current study provides more recent results compared
to those from Australia and Korea, while substantiating
their findings within a larger cohort. Further, the
associations noted among patients hospitalized in the
US illustrate that the WHO’s concerns about worse
healthcare outcomes among those who are blind are still
justified. Though the specific reasons for the higher
mortality among SVI/B patients cannot be determined
in our observational study, one possible explanation
might be that they are presenting to hospital later in the
course of illness with more advanced disease.
To explore in-hospital resource utilization, Morse
studied two claims databases - Medicare database and
Clinformatics DataMart; their objective was to compare
the care of older hospitalized patients with and without
vision loss [6]. The study found that patients with severe
vision loss had longer LOS, more readmissions, and
higher hospital costs compared to patients without vision
loss. Though our study also found that patients
with SVI/B had longer LOS, there were not significantly
higher hospital charges compared to those without this
disability. The differences in the results might be explained
by the fact that our patient population was
broader, including younger hospitalized adults. Also, it is
possible that the longer LOS may be attributable to a
greater level of complexity in coordinating safe postdischarge
care for patients with SVI/B. Lack of variance
in charges accrued over the protracted time span, and
this may be linked to Taheri’s observations that LOS attributable
to the last portion of the hospitalization does
not significantly contribute to hospital costs [23]. For
these very reasons, LOS is not always correlated with
hospital costs [24]. Given that a significantly higher
number of SVI/B patients were discharge to facilities rather
than to their homes, it may be reasonable to presume
that they did not amass high charges while
awaiting placement. Though we cannot be certain why
SVI/B patients were less often discharged home after
hospital discharge, it is not unreasonable to speculate
that difficulty complying with post-discharge plans and
therapies, either real or imagined by the inpatient care
team, may have contributed to the decision. Continuation
of some therapies after discharge (particularly
those involving injections or infusions) may be especially
difficult among those with SVI/B; places with some
supervision (e.g. rehabilitation, nursing home…) may
have been deemed to be safer and associated with a
lower risk of readmission than going home – especially
for those living alone or without reliable caregivers [25].
While homecare services can be excellent, patients with
vision impairments or other disabilities may need more
support after discharge necessitating some time in subacute
facilities before transitioning back to their homes.
The cohort of hospitalized SVI/B patients who were
obese had significantly higher average charges compared
to SVI/B patients without obesity; this result is similar to
other studies that have examined the impact of obesity
among those who are hospitalized [26–28]. However, in
contrast to Zizza, our study did not find longer lengths
of stay in patients with obesity compared to those without
obesity [29]. The prevalence of obesity may be
higher among visually impaired people compared to
those without vision impairment, and populations with
other disabilities [30, 31]. The reasons for this may be
related to both challenges with exercising or burning
calories, and barriers with securing or preparing a
healthful diet. These circumstances may result in
hospital-based providers caring for increasing proportions
of SVI/B patients who are also obese. Indeed, obesity
has been implicated as a risk factor for macular
degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetic retinopathy,
all which may ultimately result in SVI/B [32].
There are ongoing efforts trying to routinize nutritional
counseling for all obese patients while they are hospitalized
[33].
Several limitations of this study should be considered.
First, the NIS is an administrative database wherein data
is highly dependent on coding imputations. It is possible
that under-coding for SVI/B and obesity may have occurred.
Second, the NIS lacks detailed information about
visual testing results, lab data or imaging reports, and
medications. Thus, an in-depth investigation into the details
of our findings was not feasible. Third, special circumstances
that might have influenced diagnostic or
treatment decisions, such as social factors and patients’
preferences, cannot be determined from administrative
databases. Fourth, disease severity and measurements
documenting clinical status (improvement/worsening)
over the course of the hospitalization are not captured
in NIS. Lastly, in observational studies there may be unmeasured
and unknown confounders that influence outcomes.
Observed associations suggest relationships
between variables but do not prove causality.
Conclusions
Patients with severe vision impairment or blindness have
worse clinical outcomes and higher resources utilization
when hospitalized compared to those without this disability.
Hospital-based healthcare providers should
recognize this vulnerability and consider how to optimally
care for and serve this group of patients.
