Introduction
External genital warts are common. In the UK in 1998
there were 111,000 reported new cases in clinics of genitourinary
medicine [1]. Genital warts are the commonest
sexually transmitted infection, affect mainly younger
people, and usually caused by human papillomavirus
genotypes 6 or 11. These genotypes are not normally involved
with cancers. Association with human papilloma-
virus genotypes 16 and 18 can give rise to subclinical
lesions associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
and squamous cancer.
A variety of methods have been used to treat external
genital warts, and the primary goal of treatment before
1997 was the physical removal of symptomatic warts [2].
Methods used included excision, laser vaporisation, electrocautery,
cryotherapy, caustic agents like trichloroacetic
acid, podophyllin resin and intralesional interferon.
Many of these are painful, which may result in undertreatment,
whilst overtreatment can cause scarring or
other complications. These treatments can also be expensive,
as a number of outpatient visits may be required
for a satisfactory result [2], and many have high rates of
recurrence [2].
Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment have been published
[3] and promulgated [4]. These guidelines are
themselves based on earlier advice in the UK [5] and USA
[6,7]. The involvement of primary care physicians in the
treatment of genital warts is increasingly encouraged [4].
Choice of therapy depends on morphology of, and extent
of the warts, as well as patient and professional choice, as
outlined in a treatment algorithm used in Los Angeles
[2]. Availability and cost may also be considerations.
There are two choices for home treatment, imiquimod
and podophyllotoxin gel [6].
This systematic review was performed in order to quantify
the benefits and harms of imiquimod, and to provide
fuller information upon which choice can be based. The
intention was, where possible, to pool information on
important clinical outcomes and to generate not only statistical
significance between imiquimod and control, but
also to provide measures of treatment efficacy, such as
numbers needed to treat (NNT). NNT is treatment specific.
It describes the difference between active treatment
and control in achieving a particular clinical outcome
[8]. Low NNTs indicate high treatment-specific efficacy.
An NNT of 1 says that a favourable outcome occurs in
every patient given the treatment but in no patient in a
comparator group. This would be the 'perfect' result in,
say, a therapeutic trial of an antibiotic compared with
placebo with a sensitive organism. NNTs of 2 to 5 are indicative
of high efficacy (as, for instance, with analgesics
in acute pain [9]).
Imiquimod is a potent stimulator of cytokines, particularly
interferons. A review of the mechanism of action of
imiquimod is beyond the scope of this article, but there is
an excellent account by Stanley [10].
Methods
The search strategy is described in supplementary file 1.
Electronic searches were supplemented with information
from reviews [2, 10]. QUORUM guidelines were followed
[11]. Included were full publications of
randomised trials that investigated imiquimod in the
treatment of genital warts, and which had efficacy or
safety data. Excluded were reviews with clinical information
published in a fuller form elsewhere, studies with
purely biochemical or immunological information, abstracts,
or studies that used imiquimod for treating conditions
other than genital warts.
Each report was scored for quality using a three item, 1-
5 score, quality scale [12]. Points were awarded to studies
according to whether they were randomised and double
blind and mentioned withdrawals or drop-outs from the
study. An additional point was awarded if both the method
of randomisation and double blinding was described
and was appropriate.
From each trial was extracted the number of patients
treated per group, dosing regimes, study design, and the
number of patients with efficacy and/or safety outcomes.
RAM extracted the data into tables, and these were then
read and checked by other authors. Prior definitions of
outcomes of interest included those describing treatment
efficacy (wart clearance) and those describing adverse
events. For adverse events, treatment-related
adverse event withdrawal has been shown to be the most
commonly reported, and probably most useful measure
[13], but the intention was also to combine information
for particular local and systemic adverse events if reported
in ways that allowed this. Three main efficacy outcomes
and three harm outcomes were therefore sought
from the trials, using the denominator of the number of
patients randomised so that results were on an intention-
to-treat basis. The main outcomes sought were the
number of patients with:
• Complete clearance of warts present at the start of
treatment.
• At least 50% reduction in wart area.
• Complete clearance of warts and no recurrence thereafter.
• Patients withdrawing from the study because of (reported)
treatment-related adverse effects.
• Patients withdrawing from the study because of lack of
efficacy.
• Patients with particular adverse effects.
There were additional minor outcomes of interest. One
was the number of new warts that appeared after treatment
started, and the clearance of these warts during
treatment; clearly this could not be done on an intentionto-
treat basis. Recurrence was also reported as the rate of
recurrence in those patients with initial complete clearance.
Again, this could not be analysed on an intentionto-
treat basis.
Confidence intervals (95%) for single samples were calculated
for proportions [14]. Relative benefit and relative
risk estimates were calculated with 95% confidence intervals
using a fixed effects model [15]. Heterogeneity
tests were not used as they have previously been shown
to be unhelpful [16]. Publication bias was not assessed
using funnel plots as these tests have been shown to be
unhelpful [17, 18]. The number needed to treat (NNT)
and number needed to harm (NNH) with confidence intervals
were calculated by the method of Cook and Sackett
[19]. Relative benefit or risk was considered to be
statistically significant when the 95% confidence interval
did not include 1. NNT or NNH values were only calculated
when the relative risk or benefit was statistically significant,
and are reported with the 95% confidence
interval. Statistical significance of any difference between
numbers needed to treat for different doses or between
men and women was assumed if there was no
overlap of the confidence intervals, and additionally tested
using the z statistic [20].Calculations were performed
using Microsoft Excel 98 on a Power Macintosh G4.
Results
A literature search found 16 reports for which full copies
were obtained and read. Of these, 10 were excluded (supplementary
file 2) because they did not meet the inclusion
criteria. A number of these were review or other
articles with clinical information duplicated in other
publications, but always with attribution. Where information
on the same patients was available in duplicate
reports, we used studies with the fullest amount of clinical
information.
Details of the six included studies are given in supplementary
file 3. All six studies were conducted in the setting
of home administration after initial professional
examination and advice. Five of the studies were explicit
that not other treatment was allowed within at least four
weeks of the start of the trial. Wart location was predominantly
vulvar or perianal in women, and penile or perianal
in men. Five studies were conducted in North
America or the UK using 5% or 1% imiquimod cream
(Aldara, 3M Pharmaceuticals) [21,22,23,24,25], and one
[26] was conducted in Pakistan using a 2% cream manufactured
locally. This latter study was included despite
lack of clarity about the formulation or nature of what
was being applied (the title of the article indicated an imiquimod
analogue was used). The prior intention,
though, was to perform sensitivity analysis, particularly
with regard to dose. Four studies used application schedules
of 6-10 hours overnight three times a week [21,
23,24,25], one for 24 hours three times a week [22], and
the other (2% cream) applied twice a day for five consecutive
days with a two-day rest period before repeat treatment.
Duration of treatment was predominantly for 16
weeks (one study was 8 weeks with 24 hours duration for
each application [22]), with a further follow up of 10 to 16
weeks to check for recurrence.
All the trials were described as randomised and double
blind. No study described the randomisation process,
and two disclosed that treatment and placebo were visually
identical. All adequately described the number and
reasons for withdrawals or dropouts from the trials.
Quality scores were therefore 3 in four and 4 in two studies
(supplementary file 3) out of a maximum possible
score of 5 and a minimum possible score of 1.
All the studies described the diagnostic procedures to diagnose
genital warts. This was usually (four of five studies)
a combination of clinical examination supplemented
by biopsy and histology. One study used genetic techniques
to identify HPV 6 and 11 [26]. In all studies but
one wart area was assessed by inspection and mapping,
and by photography, so that warts present initially could
be identified and their area calculated and measured
over time, and any new warts similarly identified and
area measured [26].
The study populations were all adults. Five included men
and women, though one had more than 90% men [22].
One study examined only women [26]. HIV seronegativity
was a requirement in five studies, and the other examined
only patients with HIV infection [24].
Efficacy
Complete wart clearance
Pooling of data was considered for all the five studies
with immunocompetent patients (and excluding the one
study with HIV-infected patients [24]). Sensitivity analyses
were performed by concentration of imiquimod,
and by sex (using Beutner et al, 1998b [22] as data for
men, who constituted over 90% of the population investigated).
There was neither sufficient information (in
terms of number of trials) nor difference in treatments
(duration, intensity, and subsequent follow up for recurrence)
to justify separate analyses.
Complete clearance of warts was reported in all five trials
of HIV negative patients (Figure 1). This was achieved in
51% of patients (95% confidence interval 45% to 56%)
treated with the highest concentration of imiquimod (2%
in one trial, 5% in four), but in only 6% (3% to 8%) of patients
treated with placebo cream. The NNT was 2.2
(95% confidence interval 2.0 to 2.6). This means that two
patients have to be treated with 2% or 5% imiquimod for
8 to 16 weeks for one of them to have warts completely
cleared (Table 1). The results for 5% imiquimod in four
trials were similar. Substantially fewer patients were
cured with 1% imiquimod in two trials, and for this concentration
the NNT was 9.5 (5.9 to 25). In three trials results
were more favourable for women (mean 72%
clearance) than men (mean 37% clearance).
Imiquimod 5% cream was significantly more effective
than imiquimod 1% cream for complete wart clearance
(Table 1), with no overlap of confidence intervals of the
NNTs (z = 6.5, p < 0.001). Imiquimod was more effective
in women (72% of whom had complete wart clearance by
the end of treatment) than in men (37%); there was no
overlap of confidence intervals of the NNTs (z = 4.2, p <
0.001).
At least 50% reduction in wart area
This outcome was reported in four trials with imiquimod
5%, where 72% (67% to 78%) of patients had the outcome,
compared with 20% (15% to 25%) with placebo.
The NNT was 1.9 (1.7 to 2.2). This means that two patients
have to be treated with 5% imiquimod for 8 to 16
weeks for one of them to have wart area reduced by at
least 50% (Table 1). Substantially fewer patients were
cured with 1% imiquimod in two trials, and for this concentration
the NNT was 8.1 (4.7 to 30). The number of
trials and patients available for analysis by sex was small
(Table 1), and results were more favourable for women
(mean 85% with at least 50% reduction) than men (mean
68%).Imiquimod 5% cream was significantly more effective
than imiquimod 1% cream in producing at least 50%
reduction in wart area (Table 1), with no overlap of confidence
intervals of the NNTs (z = 7.1, p < 0.001). Imiq-uimod was more effective in women (85% of whom had
at least a 50% reduction in wart area) than in men (37%);
there was overlap of confidence intervals of the NNTs.
There were too few trials to give confidence to this conclusion,
however (Table 1).
Warts completely cured and not recurred
Because the object of treatment is clearance of warts
without recurrence, this outcome was sought. Three trials
with 5% imiquimod reported the number of patients
randomised, the number completely cleared at the end of
treatment, and the number of those who were completely
clear at the end of treatment and in whom new warts
were observed in the subsequent 10-16 weeks. Consequently
the number of patients fulfilling this outcome
could be calculated, with the number of patients randomised
as the intention to treat denominator.
Warts were completely cured and did not recur in 37%
(31% to 43%) of patients treated with imiquimod 5%, and
4% (2% to 6%) of patients treated with placebo. The NNT
was 3.0 (2.5 to 3.8). This means that three patients have
to be treated with 5% imiquimod for 8 to 16 weeks for one
of them to have warts completely cleared, and for them
not to recur (Table 1). Substantially fewer patients were
cured with 1% imiquimod in two trials, and for this concentration
the NNT was 10 (6.4 to 26).
Imiquimod 5% cream was significantly more effective
than imiquimod 1% cream in ensuring that warts were
completely cleared by the end of treatment and did not
recur (Table 1), with no overlap of confidence intervals of
the NNTs (z = 5.2, p < 0.001).
New warts
Three studies also reported on the number of new warts
that appeared after the start of the study and before the
end of treatment. New warts appeared in 30% (24% to
36%) of those treated with imiquimod 5%, 48% (41% to
55%) of those treated with imiquimod 1%, and 48% (42%
to 55%) of those treated with placebo. The proportion of
new warts appearing since the study started and which
had completely cleared by the end was 39% (24% to 54%;
41 patients) with 5% imiquimod, was 21% (12% to 30%;
78 patients) with placebo, and the NNT was 5.4 (2.8 to
91) (Table 1). This means that for every five patients with
new warts appearing after the trial started, one more had
the new warts cleared by the end of treatment than with
placebo.
Recurrence
Recurrence (defined as the number of patients with new
warts when previously completely cleared) in the 10-16
weeks after the end of the treatment phase was reported
in three trials. Recurrence occurred in 18/112 patients
(16%; 95% confidence interval 9% to 23%) of those treated
with imiquimod 5%, 2/30 (7%; 2% to 16%) of those
treated with imiquimod 1%, and 1/13 (8%; -7% to 22%)
of those treated with placebo. For the three large trials
[21,22,23] 121/254 patients had warts cleared at the end
of treatment with 5% imiquimod, and only 27/121 (22%)
of these had a recurrence or reinfection.
Using random effects
Because studies were clinically homogeneous a fixed-effects
model was used to calculate relative benefits. Using
a random effects model would have made no appreciable
difference, apart from the outcome of the number of patients
with 50% reduction in wart area with 1% imiquimod.
The relative benefit of 1.5 (1.1 to 2.1) found with a
fixed effects model would have changed to 1.5 (1.0 to 2.4)
by using random effects.
Adverse events
In supplementary file 4 details of how adverse events
were measured are shown, together with adverse events
and withdrawals. Most of the studies assessed local skin
reactions at the site of cream application using patient
and physician scales, though not all of the outcomes were
reported uniformly.
Commonly reported adverse events were localised itching,
erythema, burning and erosion or excoriation. The
rates of moderate or severe adverse effects are given in
supplementary file 4. They were not pooled because it
was not clear that the outcomes were the same, the numbers
of patients included as the denominator was unclear,
and information was not always given for
imiquimod and placebo. Numbers needed to harm could
not be calculated, nor could an overall weighted percentage
of patients with moderate or severe reactions. Studies
indicated that when local reactions caused problems,
a temporary "holiday" from treatment reversed them,
upon which treatment began again.
Withdrawals and the reason for withdrawals were clearly
described. All causes of withdrawal were given, predominantly
with assignment to treatment group. Treatmentrelated
withdrawal included withdrawal because of adverse
effects, and because of lack of effect. Adverse effect
withdrawals were also given, so that withdrawal rates because
of lack of effect could be calculated.
For adverse event withdrawal, there was no difference
between placebo and imiquimod at all concentrations
(relative risk 1.7; 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 9.9) or
5% cream (relative risk 1.9; 0.4 to 10, Table 2). Withdrawal
because of lack of efficacy was described in five
studies, and pooling information from the highest concentration
of imiquimod in each trial (2% or 5%) showed
that 1.7% (0.3% to 3.1%) of patients withdrew because of
lack of effect with imiquimod, compared with 7.4% (4.3%
to 11%) with placebo. The relative risk was 0.3 (0.1 to 0.7)
and the NNH was -18 (-11 to -48). This means that for
every 18 patients treated with imiquimod 2% or 5%, one
fewer will discontinue treatment because of lack of effect
than would have happened with placebo.
Imiquimod in hiv-infected patients
The single study that was conducted in this setting [24]
showed little benefit in terms of warts completely cleared
(supplementary file 3). The proportion with warts area
reduced by at least 50% was 38%, significantly better
than with placebo at 14% (supplementary file 3). New
wart appearance was similar. Adverse events were similar
to non-HIV infected individuals, though one man had
swelling and soreness of the prepuce and glans penis sufficient
to necessitate circumcision.
Discussion
This quantitative systematic review demonstrates that
imiquimod is effective in the self-treatment of genital
warts at home, at the cost of some adverse effects associated
with enhanced inflammatory reactions that were reversible
when treatment was stopped temporarily.
Studies were clinically homogeneous in terms of patient
inclusion criteria and those who were excluded. For instance,
the five studies used for data pooling all excluded
patients with HIV infection. They were also homogeneous
in terms of the treatment periods (8-16 weeks). Most
used thrice-weekly applications though one [26] used
daily application for five days with a two-day rest. In the
latter case the maximum number of applications was 60,
as compared to 48 in most others. The exception was a
study that used a 24-hour application three times a week
[22], but in that case the duration was only eight weeks.
Maximum exposure to imiquimod was therefore similar.
A possible source of heterogeneity was the source of the
imiquimod used in the trials. For five trials this was the
formulation produced by 3M Pharmaceuticals, at 1% or
5% strength. One trial used a different strength (2%)
[26], and unclear formulation. Sensitivity analysis therefore
examined the highest concentration of imiquimod in
all trials, that is data on 2% or 5% creams (Figure 1), and
with 5% and 1% imiquimod creams separately.
Outcomes used to demonstrate efficacy were also homogeneous.
These were patients with warts completely
cleared, or with wart area reduced by half. Wart measurement
was uniformly objective, with mapping and
even with photographs to ensure objectivity. One outcome
not reported, but one that could be inferred, was
that of patients with warts completely cleared by the end
of treatment, and with no recurrence of warts during the
10-16 weeks of follow up.
Numbers needed to treat for these outcomes were 2
(complete clearance or at least 50% reduction in wart area)
or 3 (warts completely cleared by the end of treatment,
and with no recurrence). This occurred despite
very different absolute percentages of patients achieving
the outcome, because placebo rates were high (20%)
with the easiest outcome (at least 50% reduction in wart
area) and as low as 4% with the hardest (warts completely
cleared by the end of treatment, and with no recurrence).
This is shown in Figure 2. Complete wart
clearance by the end of treatment was 40-50% with 5%
imiquimod (Figure 2, Table 1), with application three
times a week. This is slightly less than the 62% clearance
rate seen in a small non-randomised open study comparing
this application strategy with daily application [27]
published after searching had been completed.
There was a clear concentration-response, with 5% imiquimod
consistently achieving higher clearance rates and
lower NNTs than 1% (Table 1). Results for women were
consistently better than for men for complete clearance,
though not for at least 50% reduction in wart area (Table
1).
Recurrence of warts was described for patients in whom
warts had cleared. The results of the pooled analysis tell
us that about 50% of patients will have their warts
cleared with 5% imiquimod, and that 40% will have
warts cleared and there will be no recurrence. The implication
is that for 4 out of 5 patients in whom warts clearance
is achieved, no recurrence will occur. For the three
large trials [21,22,23] 121/254 patients had warts cleared
at the end of treatment with 5% imiquimod, and only 27/
121 (22%) of these has a recurrence. It is unclear whether
this recurrence rate of 22% can be compared with the
higher recurrence rates (up to 95% with laser therapy)
quoted for other treatments [7].
Adverse events were well recorded, especially withdrawal
due to lack of effect and adverse events [13], and the
methods used to collect adverse event information given
in the five large trials (supplementary file 4). Adverse
events were actively sought at clinic visits in most studies,
and diaries and prompts can lead to increased reporting
of adverse events [28]. Local events related to
enhancement of the inflammatory response, erythema,
itching, burning, irritation and tenderness were common
(supplementary file 4), even at a moderate or severe intensity.
Adverse events caused few patients to withdraw
(about 2%), and this was not significantly different from
placebo. Fewer patients given imiquimod withdrew because
of lack of efficacy (Table 2).
The quality of the evidence was good on several counts.
Not only was there clinical homogeneity, but the quality
scores were 3 or 4, and scores of 3 or more have been
shown [29, 30] to be associated with less likelihood of bias.
Moreover for most of the efficacy outcomes there was
enough data and a large enough effect to make it likely
that the results would be free of any chance effects [31].
Efficacy was robust to sensitivity analysis, and there was
a dose-response.
What the review cannot tell us is whether there are different
patient groups (other than men and women) who
might differentially benefit. For instance, there was no
opportunity to perform an analysis based on the severity
of the warts by number or area. That analysis could only
be done using detailed information on individual patients.
Nor was it possible to derive any information on
the many practical issues that surround management of
genital warts, such as personal hygiene, the ability to see
the warts to adequately apply the treatments, unprotected
sexual intercourse, clothing or other infections. Many
of these practical problems may be beyond the scope of
randomised trials, and therefore reviews of them.
The results of this systematic review complement guidelines
for the diagnosis and treatment of genital warts in
primary care [3, 4]. They demonstrate imiquimod to be
effective in home application, though not in patients with
HIV infection with the evidence presently available [24].
Rates of first attacks of genital warts have been rising for
a decade [32], and an average primary care group of
100,000 population will have about 240 such cases a
year, with as many again of recurrences and reregistered
cases [32]. Pressures on hospital-led clinics, or their inaccessibility
in rural areas, together with the availability
of treatments like imiquimod that can be used at home,
makes recognition of its role in primary care sensible [4].
Practitioners often want information about the relative
efficacy and harm of different treatments for the same
complaint, and, increasingly, about relative cost-effectiveness.
We could not find any systematic review of other
treatments for genital warts in this setting,
particularly for podophyllotoxin.
