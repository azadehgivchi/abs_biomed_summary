Introduction
Musculoskeletal diseases are the main causes of disability
among adults [1, 2]. Much of this disability burden is
associated with populational aging, but also with behavioural
and work-related risk factors [3]. Among musculoskeletal
diseases, neck pain is the second most
common cause of disability, second only to low back
pain [4].
From a global perspective, neck pain has a point
prevalence of 14.4%, while the mean lifetime prevalence
is 23.1% [5]. The 12-month prevalence estimates vary
from 21 to 42% among children and adolescents to 30 to
50% among adults and the elderly [6]. In Brazil, in 2017,
this prevalence among adults was estimated at 20.3% [7].
Neck pain is a complex condition, in which the association
of individual, ergonomic, socio-cultural and psychosocial
risk factors contributes to its occurrence and
chronicity [8]. The main individual factors are age, sex,
increased body mass index and smoking [9, 10]. Among
the environmental factors are those related to ergonomics,
such as strenuous physical activity, use of force and
vibration, improper posture and repetitive movements
[6]. Previous history of neck and low back pain, poor
health care and psychosocial problems such as job dissatisfaction,
stress, anxiety and depression are other factors
related to neck pain [10].
The economic impact of neck pain is significant and
includes costs related to treatment, decreased productivity,
non-attendance to work and social security [11]. In
the USA, neck pain was responsible for 16 million medical
consultations in 2010 [12]; in 2016, health costs for
neck and low back pain diagnosis and treatment were
estimated at 134 billion dollars [13]. In 2012, neck pain
was responsible for job absences of 25.5 million Americans,
who missed an average of 11.4 days of work [1].
Approximately three out of five European workers experienced
symptoms of musculoskeletal pain in 2015, with
neck and upper limbs pain accounting for 41% of the
complaints [14]. In Brazil, neck pain was responsible for
7.2% of disability pensions granted to workers with musculoskeletal
diseases [15].
The prevalence and the disability burden of neck pain
in Brazil, both countrywide and at state level, have not
yet been well defined, despite its likely impact on the
economy and health of the Brazilian population. Therefore,
this study aims to describe the prevalence and the
burden of neck pain in Brazil and in the units of the federation
in the years 2000, 2010 and 2019, as well as to
draw parallels with the estimates of other countries for
the same years.
Methodology
This descriptive study is based on the estimates from the
Global Burden of Diseases Study (GBD) 2019, a systematic
effort in descriptive epidemiology coordinated by
the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)
at the University of Washington [16]. All estimates come
from interdisciplinary approaches to enhance data quality
and statistical modeling that have been already reported
[16]. Since 2014, several investigations on the
burden of disease were conducted by the GBD Brazil
Network, which was created as a collaboration among
the IHME, the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and a network
of academic institutions led by the Federal University
of Minas Gerais [17].
Neck pain is defined as pain located between the occipital
region and the third thoracic vertebra, with or
without irradiation to one or both upper limbs, which
lasts more than 1 day and limits daily activities [18, 19].
The definition of neck pain was based on the codification
by the International Classification of Diseases, tenth
edition (ICD-10): neck pain (M54.2); cervicocranial syndrome
(M53.0); cervicobrachial syndrome (M53.1); back
pain with cervical radiculopathy (M54.1); cervical spondylosis
with radiculopathy (M47.2); cervical spondylosis
with myelopathy (M47.1); cervical disc disorder (M50);
cervicogenic headache (R51); sprain of ligaments of cervical
spine (S13.4); and sprain of joints and ligaments of
other parts of neck (S13.8) [20].
The GBD study uses three main indicators to calculate
the burden of diseases: years of life lost due to premature
mortality (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs)
and the sum of YLLs to YLDs, which corresponds to the
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [21]. Since neck
pain is not a cause of death but a disabling condition,
YLD and DALY estimates for neck pain are the same.
The disability weights used for estimating the diseases’
YLDs are measured on a scale of zero to one, in which
zero is equivalent to full health and one is equivalent to
death. Disability weights were obtained from surveys
conducted in several countries from different regions.
The surveys used paired-comparison questions, in which
the respondents considered two hypothetical individuals
with different, randomly selected health conditions and
were asked to indicate which individual they considered
to be the healthiest. More methodological details are
available elsewhere [22].
YLD due to neck pain is determined by multiplying
the specific disease disability weight (dw) by its prevalence
in a given population (p) [23]:
YLD ¼ DW x P; where YLDNP
¼ ð0:04 x Prevalence of mild acute sequelaeÞ
þ ð0:221 x Prevalence of severe acute sequelaeÞ
þ ð0:101 x Prevalence of mild chronic sequelaeÞ
þ ð0:286 x Prevalence of severe chronic sequelaeÞ
The Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) is an indicator
directly correlated to social economic standards used to
compare different locations and times. It consists of a
scale between zero and one, which aggregates the per
capita income, educational level for those ages 15 and
older, and fertility rate of women under 25 years of age.
The higher the SDI, the greater the location’s sociodemographic
development is [18].
Neck pain prevalence and YLD estimates were analyzed
for Brazil and all of its federative units. Global estimates
and estimates for other countries were also used
to compare the magnitude of national burden: 1)
Mexico, a country in Latin America with an SDI similar
to that of Brazil; 2) United States of America (USA), a
country with one of the highest prevalence and YLD
rates for neck pain; and 3) England, a developed country
with a public health system similar to Brazil’s. For each
location, data were generated by both sexes, by standardized
age, or by age group in the years 2000, 2010 and
2019.
Estimates were standardized by age to allow for a comparative
analysis that takes into account changes due to
population growth and aging. In addition, the position
and changes in the classification rank of neck pain
prevalence and YLDs were analyzed in the selected locations,
in the same years of 2000, 2010 and 2019. To describe
the degree of confidence in the metrics, the
modeling process enables estimates to be calculated
1000 times and then distributed from the lowest to the
highest value. The 95% uncertainty interval (95% UI) is
obtained from the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of this distribution,
and it considers the error generated by the sample,
the modeling, and the availability of data. All
estimates are presented with their 95% UI, and differences
between estimates are statistically significant if the
intervals are not coincident [16]. All estimates were produced
by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation
(IHME) and available in the IHME website at: http://
ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool [7]. The authors are
responsible for describe and analyze these data.
The input data for neck pain in Brazil was based on
three studies [7, 15, 24], covering the period from 2011
to 2017, two of them conducted in the state of São Paulo
[7, 24]. The data sources are available in the Global
Health Data Exchange for each country (http://ghdx.
healthdata.org/countries). Neck pain prevalence was estimated
using the software DisMod-MR 2.1, by Bayesian
meta-regression modeling tool [16]. The full list of articles
used for statistical modelling can be found in the
GBD 2019 Data Input Sources Tool [20]. To estimate
prevalence, incidence, and YLDs, the Bayesian metaregression
tool DisMod-MR 2.1 is used [16]. The modeling
allows obtaining the best estimates, mainly of the localities
such as Brazil, with few surveys and studies. In
the GBD study, data are estimated in a homogeneous
way, making it possible to compare neck pain between
locations, by sex, and by age group.
The GBD Brazil study uses only secondary data, and it
does not identify the individual or requires a free and informed
consent form. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Minas
Gerais (UFMG) under the registration n°
628,033,167.00005149, according to the resolution no.
466/2012 of the National Health Council of Brazil.
Results
In Brazil, the age-standardized prevalence of neck pain
in 2019 was 2241.9 (95% IU 1770.6 – 2870.6) per
100,000 population. This means that in that year, about
five million of the 211 million Brazilians presented with
neck pain. Also in 2019, the global age-standardized
prevalence was 2696.5 (95% IU 2177 – 3357.2) per
100,000 population, similar to the Brazilian estimates.
Throughout the study period, neck pain prevalence in
Brazil did not show statistical differences when compared
to global or Mexican estimates. On the other
hand, the prevalence estimates of the USA and England
were, in general, significantly higher (Table 1).
Most of the neck pain prevalence values remained
stable in the locations and periods surveyed. Only in the
USA there was a significant increase of the prevalence:
88.46% between 2010 and 2019, with the prevalence
varying from 2718.6 (95% IU 2386.3 – 3116.7) cases per
100,000 population to 5123.3 (95% IU 4268.4 – 6170.4)
cases per 100,000 population in the period. Prevalence
rates in Brazil showed an inverse trend when compared
to the other locations, increasing between 2000 and
2010 but decreasing from 2010 to 2019 (Table 1).
The prevalence in all Brazilian federative units
remained stable. In the year 2000, these values varied
from 1911.2 (95% IU 1503.3-2436.2) per 100,000 population
in Roraima to 1932.2 (95% IU 1515.7-2462.3) per
100,000 population in Rio de Janeiro. In 2019, these
values varied from 1915.9 (95% IU 1506.5-2443.1) per
100,000 population in the state of Roraima to 1932.1
(95% IU 1515.1-2462.7) per 100,000 population in Distrito
Federal. The only exception occurred in the state of
São Paulo, with prevalence values of 3325.7 (95% IU
2608.9 - 4274.5), 3698.6 (95% IU 3009.8 - 4592.2), and
3326.5 (95% IU 2609.7 – 4275.5) per 100,000 population
in 2000, 2010, and 2019 respectively (Table 2).
The annual change in neck pain prevalence estimates
in Brazil was 16.55% between 2000 and 2010 and −
14.59% between 2010 and 2019. In the state of São
Paulo, this variation was 11.21% between 2000 and 2010,
and − 10.06% between 2010 and 2019. The average variation
among Brazilian states was 20% between 2000 and
2010 and − 16% between 2010 and 2019. Although there
is a difference between these variations, the magnitude
of the curves for prevalence patterns in Brazil, the state
of São Paulo, and the rest of the states was similar.
Table 3 shows 2019 global prevalence estimates of
neck pain by sex and age groups, as well as agestandardized
estimates for the countries evaluated. The
prevalence is statistically higher for women in the USA,
with the same trend occurring in the other countries. In
Brazil, in 2019, the prevalence was 5376 (95% IU 3495.7-
8035.3) per 100,000 population among women and
3611.2 (95% IU 2994.3- 6999.1) per 100,000 population
among men.
The global estimates show that, worldwide, aging was
associated with a significant increase in neck pain prevalence.
In 2019, there was a statistical difference in the
global prevalence of neck pain for both sexes in the age
group of 15 to 49 years, where the estimates were 2770.4
(95% IU 2027.9 – 3851.4) per 100,000 population; in the
age group of 50 to 69 years, where the estimates were
6064.2 (95% IU 4070.1 – 9132.7) per 100,000 population;
and in the age group of 70 years and older, with prevalence
estimates of 5971.6 (95% IU 4080 – 8621.7) per
100,000 population. However, when assessing the data in
the countries evaluated, with the exception of the USA,
there was only a tendency for this increase in prevalence
with aging (Table 3).
Neck pain was the ninth clinical condition with the
highest disability burden among the 369 diseases
assessed by the GBD study in 2019, with a global agestandardized
rate of 267.4 YLD (95% IU 175, 5–383.5)
per 100,000 population. In Brazil, in 2019, it represented
the sixteenth clinical condition with the greatest impact
on the population health, with a standardized rate for
YLD of 221.7 (95% IU 145.4–322.6) per 100,000 population.
Contrary to the prevalence estimates, there was no
statistical difference between the YLD values comparing
Brazil, Mexico, the USA and England in 2010 and 2019.
According to the estimates presented in Table 2, the
USA and England had, with the exception of the year
2000, a trend of higher YLD rates, while Brazil and
Mexico tended to lower values that were closer to the
global numbers.
The age-standardized YLD rates were very similar
among the Brazilian states. The state of São Paulo
showed a trend to a higher burden of disability, with
328.5 YLD (95% IU 216.3–476.6) per 100,000 population
in 2019, but with coincident confidence intervals.
Discussion
This study shows a similar prevalence of neck pain
among the global and countries with lower SDI (Brazil
and Mexico), in contrast to higher estimates in countries
with higher SDI (England and USA). Although
generalization is not possible, other studies also showed
a higher prevalence and burden of neck pain among
countries with higher SDI [5, 23]. On the other hand,
population aging is increasing exponentially in countries
with lower SDI, under conditions of low access to diagnosis
and treatment of chronic-degenerative diseases
[25]. Barriers to accessing health care and, consequently,
receiving a diagnosis, may explain the underestimation
of data in these low-income countries [26]. In 2013, a
first Brazilian survey on spinal pain indicated an increase
from 18.5% (95%UI 17,8-19,1) (2013) to 21.6% (95%UI
21–22.1) (2019), with subnational variation in 2019 from
(13 95%UI 1.6–15.7) in the Federal District, to 26%
(95%UI 23.2–28.8) in Bahia. This survey indicates spinal
pain affects about 34.3 million Brazilians, but data did
not distinguish the specific local of spinal pain [27].
The annual change in prevalence and YLDs estimates
of neck pain in Brazil and in all of its federative units
did not follow the same patterns presented by the other
countries. While global and Mexican estimates were
stable over the period evaluated, Brazilian prevalence estimates
increased between 2000 and 2010 and then decreased
between 2010 and 2019. The opposite pattern
was presented by countries with a higher SDI such as
the USA and England. These differences can be mainly
attributable to the methodologies and data sources used
in the epidemiological studies performed in each
location.
The stability and homogeneity observed in the global
prevalence estimates, as well as for Brazil, and
Mexico, suggest the absence of population-based
prevalence studies. Likewise, most of the Brazilian
federative units presented similar prevalence estimates
22% (95% CI 19.3–25%). The third study, carried out in
the state of Rio de Janeiro, covered only among young
adults, ages ranging from 18 to 21 years old, and presents
a prevalence of 36% (95% CI 28.4–44.3%) [15]. The
Brazilian national health surveys do not address specifically
the neck pain. Methodological differences between
theses studies and GBD estimates do not allow comparison
of results.
Previous studies pointed out the higher prevalence rate
of neck pain among women [9, 28, 29], and their lower
tendency to recover from such pain [30], different from
data of more recent studies [7, 23]. A higher prevalence
of chronic spinal pain among women was also reported
in Brazil [31]. GBD estimates in 2019 showed higher
prevalence only among USA women, while the other
studied countries did not present the same trend. These
differences may represent different exposure to workrelated
risk factors and sedentary life-style as well as different
access to diagnosis in these countries.
The higher prevalence of neck pain among middleaged
adults and elderly shows the importance of age
as a risk-factor to of aging musculoskeletal diseases
[9, 31–35]. Studies have only shown a significant peak
of point prevalence in the middle age [5, 23, 30, 34].
Younger men and women have a higher prevalence of
neck pain, but recover more often from it than older
individuals. The overall rates of recurrence and
chronicity of neck pain are around 30 to 50% [8, 36].
This chronicity, added to the fact that it affects both
sexes and begins at a younger age, make the burden
of neck pain to be classified among the highest YLDs
in Brazil and in the world [37].
Despite the prevalence of neck pain being statistically
higher in the higher-income countries evaluated, the
USA and England, this difference was not significant between
the YLDs when compared to the estimates of
Brazil.. This fact suggests that neck pain affects a younger
population in Brazil, the long duration of the disease
make the YDL similar to countries with a higher
prevalence.
Despite the prevalence of neck pain is statistically
higher in the higher SDI countries evaluated, this difference
was not significant between the YLDs when compared
to the estimates of Brazil. Musculoskeletal
conditions are neglected in most national health surveys:
among 170 national health surveys from different countries,
only 37 cited cervical pain [38]. Besides, the different
definitions of neck pain prevent the comparison
[38]. The higher rates presented in the US are probably
related to the inclusion of neck pain investigation in annual
surveys since 2013, the availability of regular data
providing more reliable information.
Low income is a risk factor for chronic spinal pain and
is associated with a worse prognosis for chronic neck pain
[7, 31]. More recent studies have revealed a higher prevalence
of chronic neck pain and a notable association with
people with low education [39, 40]. Thus, since the burden
of the disease depends on the sum of the prevalence of the
different spectra of the disease, which in the case of neck
pain encompasses severity and chronicity, the fact that
lower SDI countries have a YLD similar to that of higher
SDI could be justified by a higher prevalence of chronic
and severe neck pain in these locations.
The GBD Project systematically updates global and national
estimates of the burden of several diseases, aiming
to encourage detailed analysis for decision making at a
local level. Regarding the scientific production using
GBD estimates, the GBD Brazil Network has done several
analyses that have resulted in the publication of two
capstone papers and two journal supplements on the
burden of several diseases [17]. This study presents the
current Brazilian status of the burden of neck pain with
the best available data. Considering Brazilian subnational
diversity, obtaining reliable estimates is challenging. Our
results emphasize the importance of the research on
musculoskeletal diseases in the country, especially in the
current context of economic and political crisis, with
funding restriction [41].
This study presents as a strength the standardized
methodology that enables comparisons between locations
and times. On the other hand, it does not distinguish
between the risk factors associated with the onset
and recurrence of cervical pain, nor does it analyze the
risk factors common to cervical pain, such as exposure
to high-demand work, smoking history, psychological
disorders, low educational level and a past history of cervical
pain [42, 43], since these were not addressed by the
GBD study.
Given the trend for population aging, greater investments
in public health policies are necessary to avoid individual
and financial losses. The results of this study
can contribute to the understanding of the importance
of neck pain and help improve the prevention and control
of risk factors for chronic degenerative diseases programs.
In addition, it highlights the importance of
diagnosis, early treatment and adequate rehabilitation,
which tend to reduce the disability generated by neck
pain.
