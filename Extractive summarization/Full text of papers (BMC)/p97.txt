Background
Research to obtain new antimalarial drugs, both synthetic
drugs and those derived from natural materials, especially
from plants, is still ongoing. One of Indonesian plants that
has been traditionally recognized to treat malaria is Cassia
spectabilis DC from the Caesalpiniaceae family. Previous
study related to this plant using in vivo test showed that
this plant was a potential antimalarial phytomedicine [1].
New antimalarial active compounds have also been ob-
tained from different plant, Cassia siamea from the same
genus of C. spectabilis that identified as Cassiarin A alkaloid
compound [2, 3]. Based on these results, an in vitro test on
antiplasmodial activity to find out the active compound
isolated from C. spectabilis DC has been conducted.
Prevention of malaria can be done in various ways, one
of which is chemoprophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis is one
way to reduce the risk of malaria infection and alleviate
clinical symptoms of malaria. Chemoprophylaxis used
before
traveling
to
malaria
endemic
area
to
avoid
infection. In Indonesia, therapeutic choice used for
malaria prophylaxis is doxycycline and tetracycline [4].
Both can be used as chemoprophylaxis for malaria but
there are many undesirable effects from this drug [5].
Therefore, this research was performed to find out and
develop drugs that can be used as an effective antimalarial
prophylaxis, safe, have few side effects, cheap, and easy to
obtain, especially those from plants, namely C. spectabilis
DC leaf.
Furthermore,
antimalarial
drug
development
and
discovery is expected to provide new drugs which is not
only have antiplasmodial activity in vitro and in vivo, but
also has a safety mechanism to be applied to human.
Research related to the biochemical process that unique of
malaria parasites plays an important role in the develop-
ment
of
new
antimalarial
drugs.
Malaria
parasites
consume hemoglobin from erythrocytes during their life
cycle, however, parasites are unable to digest iron-
containing heme molecule. Heme is toxic due to the
reactivity of iron. Therefore, parasite has developed the
mechanism to detoxify it by polymerization of heme to
form hemozoin or malaria pigmen [6, 7]. The structure of
hemozoin through X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy
has been found to be similar to β-hematin [8] β-hematin
is synthetic hemozoin which chemically [8], spectroscopic-
ally [9] and crystallographically [10] similar to hemozoin
which consists of Ferriprotoporphyrin units linked into a
polymer by propionate oxygen-iron bonds [8, 11]. The
inhibition of heme detoxification has been the target
of antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine and artemi-
sinin [12, 13], since inhibit the heme detoxification
can kill the parasites. Currently, the effect of ethanol
extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf on biochemical activ-
ity such as potential inhibition of heme detoxification
in the food vacuole of malaria parasite and stage-
specific activity against asexual stage of parasite has
been tested.
In addition, parasitic resistance to some of the existing
antimalarial drugs is the biggest problem in overcoming
this disease, especially in malaria endemic areas [14].
The combination therapy with artemisinin derivatives or
commonly referred to artemisinin-based combination
therapy (ACT) is highly recommended by WHO as the
preferred therapy that is able to control the spread of re-
sistance of P. falciparum [15, 16]. Previous studies have
found an effective dose of 90% ethanolic extract of C.
spectabilis DC leaf was 150 mg/kg bodyweight which
were given three times daily [1].
Based on this result, both ethanolic extract of C. spect-
abilis DC leaf alone and in combination with artesunate
has been tested to determine the inhibition of growth of
parasites in P. berghei ANKA-infected mice in vivo, since
the ACT is more effective in reducing parasitemia [17].
The combination therapy will be carried out in extract-
drug regimens and an overview of the resulting antimal-
arial activity will be obtained. A therapeutic effect of an
appropriate combination of artesunate and 90% ethano-
lic extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf is reported herein.
Methods
Plant material
C. spectabilis DC leaf was obtained from Purwodadi Bo-
tanical Garden-Indonesian Institute of Sciences [Lem-
baga
Ilmu
Pengetahuan
Indonesia,
LIPI],
Pasuruan
District, East Java Province, Indonesia, and the determin-
ation of specimen was performed at the above institu-
tion. The specimen was then deposited as herbarium in
the Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry,
Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Airlangga with registra-
tion number of 02/W/XI/2016.
Parasite and culture preparation
Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain was obtained from
Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya.
The parasite was cultured in complete RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 5.96 g HEPES, 0.05 g hypo-
xanthine, 2.1 g NaHCO3, 50 μg/ml gentamycin and com-
pleted with 10% human O+ serum under anaerobe
condition and incubated in a 37 °C incubator [18]. Para-
sitemia was observed daily prior to antimalarial assay.
Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain was originally ob-
tained from Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology,
Jakarta, and maintained at Faculty of Pharmacy, Univer-
sitas Airlangga. The P. berghei ANKA was infected into
male BALB/c mice and observed the parasitemia level.
Experimental animals
Experimental animal used in this study was BALB/c
strain male mice obtained from Faculty of Veterinary
Ekasari et al. BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies           (2021) 21:71 
Page 2 of 12
Medicine of Universitas Airlangga with a weight of ±20–
30 g.
Mice
were
acclimatized
for
2
weeks
at
a
temperature of 24 ± 1 °C and humidity of 55 ± 5% prior
to in vivo test. In all in vivo experiments, the animals
were kept in cages with raised, wide-mesh floors to pre-
vent coprophagy. The ethical certificate was obtained
from the Ethic Commission of Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine of Universitas Airlangga No: 2.KE.181.10.2018.
At the end of the tests, all animals were followed the
euthanasia procedure. The mice were sacrificed by cer-
vical dislocation after anesthesia by intraperitoneal injec-
tion of 100 mg/kg bodyweight ketamine [19]. The dead
animals were then buried.
Extraction
The extract was made by three times macerating dried
C. spectabilis DC leaf powder using 90% ethanol. The

macerated
extract
was
then
evaporated
using
a
rotavapor.
Isolation of compound from C. spectabilis DC leaf
A thousand grams of dried powder of C. spectabilis DC
leaf was macerated with n-hexane, then the pulp powder
was extracted again with methanol. The extract was sub-
jected to liquid-liquid partition using ethyl acetate and
3% tartaric acid. The isolation proceess was done by
adding 3% tartaric acid until the atmosphere becomes
acidic to turn the alkaloids in alkaline form into alka-
loids salts. This alkaloid salt was partitioned using ethyl
acetate, and the alkaloids were present in the aqueous
acidic layer at the bottom. The alkaloid was the isolated
from their salt form in aqueous layer, by adding NaCO3
to increase the pH to 9–10, and the alkaloids returned
to alkaline form. Furthermore, the aqueous layer with
pH 9–10 was then extracted liquid-liquid using chloro-
form. The fractions so called chloroform fraction.
The isolate pure alkaloid compound from other com-
pounds, the chloroform fraction, was further fractiona-
tioned by column chromatography using stationary
phase of silica gel 60 with a series of gradient mobile
phases was started using 100% chlorofom, chloroform:
ethyl acetate (CHCl3: EtOAc; 2:1), chloroform:ethyl acet-
ate:methanol (CHCl3: EtOAc: MeOH; 2:1:2), and finally
100% methanol. The selection of the mobile phase was
based on the results of the orientation by TLC, which
gave good separation results. The solvent used for each
gradient was 200 ml and the collected fractions were
combined based on similarity of the TLC profile. Nine
fractions (C.1-C.9) were obtained.
The fractions were then assayed for their antiplasmo-
dial activity. The active fraction was then subjected to
silica gel 60 column chromatography and was eluted
using CHCl3: MeOH (1: 00: 1) to yield sub-fractions
(SFC.8.1-SFC.8.4).
The
sub-fractions
were
further
assayed for their antiplasmodial activity. The antimalarial
active sub-fraction was then purified by preparative thin-
layer chromatography (PTLC) using CHCl3: MeOH (8.5:
1.5) to yield compounds C.8.3.1 and C.8.3.2. Identifica-
tion of active compound was carried out using the TLC-
densitometry, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, FTIR spec-
troscopy, and NMR. The procedures employed for the
preparation of the plant active compounds are illustrated
in Fig. 1.
In vitro antiplasmodial activity test
The extract was dissolved in DMSO (the final DMSO
concentration in a well culture plate not more than
0.5%) and diluted with complete RPMI medium contain-
ing RPMI 1640, 10% human plasma, 25 mM HEPES, and
25 mM NaHCO3 to make the final concentrations of 10,
1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 μg/ml. Stock of parasite cultures
were further diluted with uninfected type O+ human
erythrocytes and culture medium to make initial parasit-
emia of 1% and a hematocrit of 2%. This final parasite
culture was immediately used for antiplasmodial assay.
The test was carried out in duplicate. The plates con-
taining parasite cultures and extracts were then incu-
bated in a 37 °C incubator in a candle jar for 48 h.
Observation of stage-specific antiplasmodial activity in
this in vitro test was performed by sampling the blood
films from each well at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. At the end of
test thin films were prepared from each well and stained
with 10% Giemsa solution prior to counting parasitemia
[20]. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value was
determined using probit analysis based on the relation of
log concentration of test compound and % inhibition of
parasites growth.
In vivo antimalarial prophylactic activity test
In vivo test for antimalarial prophylactic activity of 90%
ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf used Peters
method with slight modification [21]. Forty two male
adult BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six
groups [22]. Group 1 as a negative control group was
given a 0.5% Na CMC suspension solution. Groups 2, 3,
4, and 5 were given extract at the doses of 100, 200, 400,
and 800 mg/kg, respectively. Group 6 as a positive con-
trol group was given a doxycycline of 13 mg/kg suspen-
sion solution. Each treatment was given orally once a
day for 4 days before parasite infection. On the fourth
day the mice were infected with P. berghei ANKA. Each
mouse in each group was infected with 1 × 106 infected
erythrocytes. Thin blood films from each mouse were
made at 72 h post infection. Determination of parasit-
emia, percentage of the parasites’ growth, percentage

Suppressive effect of ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis DC
leaf combined with artesunate
The purpose of this test was to increase the effectiveness
of the extract. The suppressive effect of ethanolic extract
of C. spectabilis DC leaf in combination with artesunate,
respectively against P. berghei ANKA infection in mice
was determined using Peters’ 4-day suppression test pro-
cedure [21]. A donor mouse densely infected with para-
sites was anaesthetized with chloroform and the blood
was collected through cardiac puncture. The presence of
parasitemia was established by microscopic examination
of a thin blood film. The blood was diluted with phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS) so that each 0.2 ml of blood
contained 1 × 106 P. berghei ANKA infected with eryth-
rocytes. A total of 0.2 ml of diluted blood was injected
intraperitoneally into 36 healthy mice. The infected ani-
mals were randomly divided into six groups those were
Group A-F. The animals were treated shortly after in-
oculation on day zero (D0). Group A was given artesu-
nate at 36.4 mg/kg, on D0-D2. Group B was given
ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf at 150 mg/kg
(three times a day) concurrently with artesunate at 36.4
mg/kg (once a day), on D0-D2. Group C was given
ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf at 150 mg/kg
(three times a day) on D0-D2 and artesunate at 36.4 mg/
kg (once a day), on D0. Group D was given ethanolic ex-
tract of C. spectabilis DC leaf at 150 mg/kg (three times
a day) on D0-D2 and artesunate at 36.4 mg/kg (once a
day), on D2. Group E was given amodiaquine at 72.8 mg/
kg concurrently with artesunate at 36.4 mg/kg, once a
day, on D0-D2. Group F received 0.2 ml of 0.5% Na
CMC solution as control group. Oral route was used for
all administration. On day three (D3), thin film was
made from each mouse-tail blood stained with Giemsa.
Determination of parasitemia level, percentage parasites’
growth, percentage inhibition of parasites’ growth, and
the ED50 were as described on Ekasari et al. [20].
Heme polymerization inhibition test
The inhibition of heme polymerization test was performed
based on the Basilico method [23] with slight modification
in the concentration of hematin solution and the sample
used. The Basilico method is an in vitro spectrophotomet-
ric microassay of heme polymerization. A 96-well U-
bottomed microplates was used in this assay. The relative
amounts of polymerized and unpolymerized hematin were
determined using an ELISA reader. The final concentra-
tion of the extract samples ranged from 2 to 0.01 mg/ml.

A 100 μl of 1 mM hematin solution was mixed with 0.2
M NaOH and 50 μl of the test extract. A 50 μl of glacial
acetic acid solution (pH 2.6) was then added to this mix-
ture. This test was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h. The micro-
tube was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min, the
sediment was then washed with 200 μl of DMSO three
times at 8000 rpm for 10 min. The β-hematin crystalline
precipitated was dissolved in 200 μl of NaOH 0.1 M to form
alkaline hematin. A 100 μl of the alkaline hematin solution
was transferred to 96-well microplates and the absorbance
was read by ELISA reader at a wavelength of 405 nm. The
effects of each test substance on β-hematin production
were calculated and compared with negative controls.
Results
In vitro antiplasmodial activity test
All the extracts, fractions, sub-fractions, and isolated
compounds from C. spectabilis DC leaf were continu-
ously screened in vitro for their antiplasmodial activity
against chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum (3D7 strain),
using microtechnique which demonstrated on the previ-
ous study [24]. The samples for these tests were hexane
extract, methanolic extract, ethyl acetate fraction and
chloroform fraction. The results are shown in Table 1.
Antiplasmodial activity was classified based on the Gess-
ler et al. [25], where antiplasmodial activity of extract
was considered very good, moderate, and low with IC50
value less than 10 μg/ml, 10 to 50 μg/ml, and more than
50 μg/ml, respectively.
During isolation of compound, chloroform was used
to fractionate the extract. Chloroform fractionation re-
sulted in nine fractions called C.1-C.9. In vitro antiplas-
modial activity test of these fractions showed that
fraction C.8 was the most active fraction with IC50 was
0.02 μg/ml (Table 2). Purification of fraction C.8 resulted
in four sub-fractions called SFC.8.1-SFC.8.4, and their
antiplasmodial activity is shown in Table 3. Sub-fraction
SFC.8.1 and SFC.8.3 showed antiplasmodial activity
against P. falciparum 3D7 strain with IC50 0.012 and
0.015 μg/ml,
respectively.
The
purification
of
sub-
fractions SFC.8.3 resulted in two compounds called
compound C.8.3.1 and C.8.3.2 and their antiplasmodial
activity is shown in Table 4 and Fig. 2. Compound
C.8.3.1
and
C.8.3.2
showed
antiplasmodial
activity
against P. falciparum 3D7 strain with IC50 0.016 and
0.070 μg/ml, respectively.
Identification using TLC-densitometry showed that
compound C.8.3.1 was in the range of λ 200–300 nm,
with a value of RF = 0.65. Identification using FTIR spec-
troscopy showed an absorption peak at 472.53 cm− 1;
657.68 cm− 1; 786.9 cm− 1; 864.05 cm− 1; 1101.28 cm− 1;
1382.87 cm− 1 (Fig. 3).
Identification using 1H-NMR spectroscopy showed a
characteristic signal of two hydroxyl protons at δ 3.60
ppm (1H, s); and δ 3.69 ppm (1H, s), two protons from
the CH2 group of benzene at δ 1.91 ppm (2H, s, H-4)
and δ 1.68 ppm (2H, s, H-5), one methyl group at δ 2.13
ppm (3H, s, H-12′), and some cassettes of the CH2
groups of the aliphatic chain at δ 1.38 ppm (2H, s, H-1′);
at δ 1.22 ppm (2H, s, H-2′- H-8′); at δ 1.51 ppm (2H, s,
H-9′), and at δ 2.35 ppm (2H, t, H-10′). Identification
using 13C-NMR spectroscopy showed the presence of
one carbon with a ketone group at δ 179.0 ppm, carbon
in the benzene group at δ 56.96 ppm; δ 67.13 ppm; δ
29.23 ppm; δ 25.77 ppm; and δ 48.29 ppm, carbon in the
aliphatic chain at δ 34.32 ppm; δ 25.87 ppm; δ 29.23
ppm; δ 29.33 ppm; δ 22.89 ppm; and δ 38.87 ppm, one
carbon in the methyl group at δ 30.23 ppm, and one car-
bon in the hydroxyl group at δ 65.27 ppm.

Effect of C. spectabilis on parasitic stage development
Stage-specific activity test of 90% ethanolic extract of C.
spectabilis DC leaf against P. falciparum 3D7 strain was
performed at different incubation periods of 0, 6, 12, 24,
and 48 h to find out the effect of the extract to the
growth of parasites at each stage of development. The
extract concentration used was 100 μg/ml. The results of
this experiment are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 4.
No sharp difference was observed on the growth of
each parasitic stage during incubation period of 0–12 h.
However, opposite direction of percentage parasitemia
was seen at 12 to 48 h post incubation compared with

The dose of extract of 800 mg/kg provided the
greatest inhibitory effect (68.61%) compared to other
doses. Probit analysis resulted in ED50 value was
161.20 mg/kg.
In vivo antiplasmodial suppressive activity test
Table 7 shows the results of suppressive activity tests by
C. spectabilis DC leaf extract combined with artesunate.
Suppressive effects produced
by the
three extract-
artesunate combinations were higher than artesunate
alone. Moreover, the suppressive effects of group D
(ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf at 150 mg/kg
(three times a day) on D0-D2 and artesunate at 36.4 mg/
kg on D2) was higher (99.18%) than those showed by
artesunate alone (82.60%) and artesunate-amodiaquine
combination (92.88%).
Heme polymerization inhibition test
The IC50 value of the heme inhibition test by 90% etha-
nolic extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf was 0.375 mg/ml,
while chloroquine as an antimalarial standard compound
was 0.682 mg/ml (Table 8).
Discussion
Anti-malarial activities of C. spectabilis DC leaf was con-
ducted to extract, fraction and pure isolate. The active

Parasitic morphology and the development of each stage were assessed at the beginning of incubation (0 h) and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. The
stages of parasite were classified in three groups: ring, trophozoite, and schizont. The parasitic differential count was reported as a percentage of
the total red blood cells infected with those stages. Five bars in each group according to different incubation times (left to right): 0, 6, 12, 24, and

compounds were identified by TLC-densitometry, UV-
Vis spectrophotometry, FTIR spectroscopy, and NMR.
In the 1H-NMR spectra, compound C.8.3.1 showed simi-
larities to the compound (−)-7-hydroxycassine (Fig. 6) in
the presence of several similar chemical shifts [26].
The greatest prophylactic inhibitory effect in vivo of
90% ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf against P.
berghei ANKA was 68.61% provided by the mice treated
with 800 mg/kg of the extract. This result was lower
than that of mice treated with doxycycline (73.54%). The
highest dose that can be used in mice is 1000 mg/kg of
bodyweight [27].
The effect of 90% ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis
DC leaf to inhibit heme detoxification process showed
the IC50 value of 0.375 mg/ml which was higher than
that of chloroquine as a standard antimalarial drug
which was 0.682 mg/ml.
The potential for 90% ethanolic extract of C. spect-
abilis DC leaf in the inhibition of hemozoin formation
caused morphological and growth disturbances of mal-
aria parasites due to membrane damage and disruption
of the activity of several enzymes [28] as seen during the
12-h incubation period where the inhibitory activity 70%
increase compared to controls. Furthermore, after 24 h
incubation, the growth of parasites was 100% inhibited
compared to the control (Table 5).
The advantage of the combination therapy was to in-
crease the effectiveness of extract to prevent or slow the
onset of resistance to a single antimalarial drug [29]. Se-
lection of 90% ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf
combination with artesunate referred to the basis of
malaria treatment which is a standard antimalarial drug
recommended by WHO [30].
The dose of 90% ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis DC
leaf used was 150 mg/kg given three times [1]. Artesu-
nate is the artemisinin derivative is a schizonticidal with
fast onset of action and gametocytocidal which can re-
duce malaria transmission in endemic areas [31]. Artesu-
nate at a dose of 36.4 mg/kg was converted dose from
human to mouse. The three times a day of artesunate
therapy was compared to single dose therapy to prevent
the immediate emerging of parasites resistance to this
antimalarial drug. The control used in this study was a
single dose of artesunate alone at the dose of 36.4 mg/kg
and amodiaquine alone at the dose of 72.8 mg/kg which
were given for 3 days. As recommended by WHO that
ACT administration that given for 3 days has been able
to effectively inhibit the growth of parasites, beside anti-
malarial drug should be effective, safe, and used in a
short time. The Na CMC was used as negative control
since this solvent was used to dissolve the extract in this
test.
The interesting result was seen in the combination
therapy using three times a day of 90% ethanolic extract
of C. spectabilis DC leaf at dose of 150 mg/kg for 3 days
with a single dose of artesunate at the dose of 36.4 mg/
kg given on the third day. This combination therapy
showed a higher inhibitory activity (99.18%) compared
to that of combination artesunate and amodiaquine for 3
days (92.88%). This combination therapy may overcome

the resistance of parasites to artesunate because shorten the
duration of treatment period. Thus, the combination of
90% ethanolic extract of C. spectabilis DC leaf with artesu-
nate can be expected as a new antimalarial combination
drug which may replace the artesunate-amodiaquine com-
bination drug that has been used so far. The mixture of
artesunate-amodiaquine caused the drug preparations will
become unstable [32]. Concurrent drug administration in a
separate formula have the disadvantage of reducing patient
compliance to take the drug, but the combination therapy
can shorten the duration of treatment therapy [30].
Conclusion
The results show 90% ethanolic extract of C.spectabilis
DC leaf has a very good antiplasmodial activities both
in vitro and in vivo study and revealed potentiated effect
in combination with artesunate. The 90% ethanol extract
of C. spectabilis DC leaf also found to be active in inhi-
biting the heme detoxification process. Compound of
(−)-7-hydroxycassine may play as important role in anti-
malarial activities. Therefore, this plant can be poten-
tially used as a new source for the development of new
plant-based antimalarial agent.
