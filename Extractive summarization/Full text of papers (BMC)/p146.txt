Among independently living, normally aging study populations,
evidence exists to support an association between
more optimal nutriture (measured by dietary intake or
blood parameters) and better performance on cognitive
tests [1-3]. Some researchers have suggested that even
marginal nutritional status may affect cognitive function
[4]. The findings in a six-year follow-up study by La Rue et
al [3] showed significant associations between past and
concurrent nutrient intakes and better cognitive performance.
This would suggest a benefit of a more global diet
throughout adulthood.
The role of specific B vitamins in brain related disorders –
vitamin B12 or niacin in severe cases of cognitive dysfunction
[5], folate in depression [6], and vitamin B6 in convulsive
seizures [7] – has also prompted research on
micronutrients and their potential to mitigate cognitive
deterioration. Discounting niacin, which has received less
attention from researchers, relations of these B vitamins
and their metabolic derivative homocysteine (Hcy) to
cognitive performance have been demonstrated [8]. Compared
to control populations, there also appears to be significantly
elevated Hcy [9,10] and low B12 and folate
levels among Alzheimer disease patients [9].
Levels of vitamin B12 [11,12], folate [11] and vitamin B6
[13,14] are often insufficient among older persons. For
vitamin B12 and folate, reduced gastric acid secretion
(hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria) from atrophic gastritis
[15] or the use of medications [16] impair absorption of
these vitamins. For vitamin B6 it appears the problem is
not an absorptive one, but rather one of cellular uptake or
metabolism of the vitamin [17]. Questions have been
raised as to whether or not circulating serum vitamin levels
are a true measure of deficiency [18]. For this reason,
Hcy has been touted as a more reliable measure of deficiency
since its metabolism is dependent on functional
vitamin B12, folate and vitamin B6 in tissue. Its usefulness
is however limited by genetic, demographic, lifestyle, and
pathophysiological factors, all capable of elevating Hcy
[19].
Vitamin insufficiencies have been implicated in neurodegenerative
disorders and vascular disease; hyperhomocysteinemia
already confirmed as an independent risk
factor in the latter [20]. With an ever-increasing aging
population in North America, ensuring adequate nutriture
carries many advantages related to longevity of life
and savings in public health resources. To better understand
the nutritional needs of institutionalized older persons
in Ontario, our study evaluated vitamin status (B12,
folate, B6, niacin, Hcy) and its association with cognitive
function, vitamin supplementation and medication use.
Methods
Ethics and subject recruitment
Ethics approval was granted by the Research Ethics Board
of St. Joseph's Hospital (Hamilton, ON). Information and
consent letters outlining the study's objectives and details
of subject involvement were sent out to families of residents.
St. Joseph's Hospital and Home, located in Guelph
Ontario, provides long-term high level care, rehabilitation
and out-reach services typical of Type II and III facilities
across Canada. Medical and nursing staff gave approval
for more cognizant residents to individually consent (verbal
or written). Family consent was otherwise required for
less independent residents with more severe cognitive
impairments. Of the total 127 long-term care residents, 8
residents died during subject recruitment and 44 did not
grant consent, because they or their guardians were worried
about blood work, guardians thought the resident
may be upset by the mini-mental state exam, or were too
frail to participate. There were no overall differences
between the range of illnesses in participating and nonparticipating
subjects. Seventy-five residents (47 females,
28 males) consented. All 75 participated in the blood
work and 67 out of 75 residents partook in the Standardized
Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE). There
were no exclusion criteria for subject involvement given
the cross-sectional nature of the study. Of the 75 subjects,
46 had been diagnosed with dementia. Twenty-nine subjects,
although not being diagnosed with dementia had
several other diagnoses that could affect cognitive function.
These included: Parkinson's disease, mental retardation,
multiple sclerosis, head injury, transient ischemia
attack, hemiplegia, hemiparesis, cerebrovascular attack
and seizures. The average age of the subjects was 80.7 yrs
(range 48–100) with no difference between males and
females. The average duration of long-term care was 1.85
yrs (range 0.1–9) and was not different between males
and females.
Medical and nutritional data
Medical charts were used to collect information on age
and gender. A list of medications and vitamin supplementation
(oral, intramuscular) was provided by the pharmacy.
Medications of interest were proton pump
inhibitors (PPIs) (i.e. Losec®) and histamine-2 receptor
antagonists (H2-blockers) (i.e. Zantac® or Axid®). A multivitamin
(5000 I.U. vitamin A, 3 mg vitamin B1, 2.5 mg
vitamin B2, 20 mg niacinamide, 1 mg vitamin B6, 3 μg
vitamin B12, 50 mg vitamin C, 400 I.U. vitamin D) and a
1000 μg intramuscular vitamin B12injection were considered
for vitamin supplementation. Of the 28 subjects
using vitamin supplements, 10 had B12 injections and 18
took the standard oral multivitamin supplement. Supplement
prescriptions were provided by each subject's family
doctor and not based on any pre-determined deficiency
symptoms. There were no differences between users/non
users of drugs or supplements according to age or gender.
Because incidence of specific disease were low for all categories
differences in frequency between users and nonusers
could not be determined.
Cognitive status
The SMMSE was used to assess the degree of cognitive
impairment. To decrease methodological faults and
assure methodological reliability, the administrator: 1)
Reviewed the SMMSE procedure and grading system outlined
in a short booklet and video, 2) Observed a geriatrician
conduct the SMMSE on residents not part of the study
and 3) Was supervised when conducting the SMMSE on
residents not part of the study. The SMMSE was administered
on 67 of the 75 residents that gave consent for study
participation. Subjects were categorized according to the
following: marked cognitive impairment (scores between
0 and 20); mild cognitive impairment (scores between 21
and 25); and normal (scores between 26 and 30). Residents
that participated but were mute and/or unresponsive
to the administrator's cues received a score of zero out
of 30 [21].
Blood collection and analysis
Blood was collected after an overnight fast at a time when
routine annual creatinine measurements would have to
be taken. Five tubes of blood were drawn from each resident:
One 5 ml SST tube for creatinine and serum B12, one
2 ml EDTA tube for erythrocyte folate, two 5 ml EDTA
tubes for Hcy and vitamin B6, and one 6 ml heparin tube
for niacin and methylmalonic acid (analysis incomplete).
Blood samples were immediately placed on ice. Blood
was collected from six to ten subjects per day over a period
of nine days. Within 1.5 hours of blood collection, 100 μL
of whole blood from the heparin tube was transferred to
a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube; EDTA tubes for Hcy and B6 analysis
were immediately centrifuged and the plasma transferred
into clean tubes. Hcy samples were stored at -20°C,
niacin and B6 samples at -70°C. Blood samples for creatinine,
serum B12 and erythrocyte folate analysis were
immediately transported to the laboratory for analysis.
Chemiluminescent immunoassays were used for the
quantitative determination of vitamin B12 and erythrocyte
folate (Guelph General Hospital Laboratory Services,
Guelph, ON, Canada). It was decided to measure erythrocyte
folate rather than serum folate since the former
reflects tissue stores of folate and is a more stable marker
of folate status. Serum folate is more affected by recent
changes in dietary intake [2,21]. The coefficients of variation
for cobalamin were as follows: mean value 65 pmol/
L (5% CV within run, 8.5% CV for total precision); mean
value 276 pmol/L (4.8% CV within run, 6.6% CV for total
precision); mean value 572 pmol/L (6.9% CV within run,
7.5% CV for total precision); mean value 719 pmol/L
(11.4% CV within run, 11.4% CV for total precision). The
coefficients of variation for erythrocyte folate were as follows:
mean value 292 nmol/L (2.5% CV within run, 7.8%
CV for total precision); mean value 884 nmol/L (2.3% CV
within run, 5.9% CV for total precision); mean value 1375
nmol/L (3.1% CV within run, 5.7% CV for total precision);
mean value 1948 nmol/L (2.4% CV within run,
5.8% CV for total precision).
Creatinine blood samples were sent to Guelph General
Hospital Laboratory, Guelph, ON, Canada (3% CV within
run, 4.5% CV for total precision). Creatinine combined
with picric acid to produce a colored creatinine-picrate
complex. The differential absorbance measured (520 nm
and 560 nm) was proportional to creatinine concentration.
Creatinine clearance was calculated using the formula
of Cockcroft and Gault: [(140-
age(years))*weight(kg)]/[serum creatinine (μmol/
L)*0.81]. For women, this value was multiplied by 0.85.
Vitamin B6 blood samples were sent on dry ice to St.
Joseph's Health Centre, Reference Testing Centre, London,
ON, Canada (3.5% CV within run, 4.8% CV between
runs). Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) was detected by
HPLC (C18 ODS reversed-phase column) and fluorometric
detection (325 nm excitation, 400 nm emission) after
post column derivatisation with pH 7.5 phosphate buffer
containing 1 g/L sodium sulphite. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate
(0 to 200 nmol/L) were used as calibrators. Pyridoxamine
5'-phosphate was used as an internal standard.
Hcy blood samples were sent on dry ice to the Lab Reference
Centre, Hamilton General Hospital, Hamilton, ON,
Canada. A fluorescence polarization immunoassay was
followed for the quantitative measurement of total L-Hcy.
Gravimetrically prepared S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine in
phosphate buffer (2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 50.0 μmol/L Hcy)
and phosphate buffer (0 μmol/L Hcy) were used as calibrators.
L-Hcy in processed human serum at known concentrations
(7.0 μmol/L, 12.5 μmol/L and 25.0 μmol/L)
were used as controls. The coefficients of variation were as
follows: mean value 5.9 μmol/L (2.2% CV within run,
5.2% CV for total precision); mean value 10.8 μmol/L
(1.9% CV within run, 4.1% CV for total precision); mean
value 21.6 μmol/L (1.4% CV within run, 3.7% CV for total
precision).
Niacin status was measured using the method of Jacobson
and colleagues [22]. The coefficients of variation were as
follows: NAD (10% CV within and between runs); NADP
(11% CV within run and 14% CV between runs).
Reference values
Low B12 levels were defined as <148 pmol/L. Normal levels
of B12, but at the lower end (low normal), were classified as 148 to 221 pmol/L. Plasma PLP ≤ 30 nmol/L,
erythrocyte folate < 370 nmol/L, niacin ratio (NAD/
NADP) ≤1, and Hcy >13.3 μmol/L were indicative of low
vitamin and elevated metabolite concentrations [22],
respectively.
Statistical analysis
Summary statistics (mean, median, range, 95% confidence
interval) was determined using the original (nontransformed)
variables. Parametric tests such as analysis
of variance, regression models, and independent t-tests
were performed on log(base 10) transformed variables to
meet the assumption of normal distribution for the continuous
variables (vitamin B12, vitamin B6, erythrocyte
folate, niacin number (NAD/NADP*100) and Hcy). In
determining the prevalence of vitamin supplementation
within SMMSE or drug user groups chi-square analysis
was conducted. Probablity values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All analyses were done by using
SPSS computer software (version 7.7).
Results
Table 1 lists the summary statistics and prevalence data for
the vitamins and metabolites. The mean, median and
95% confidence intervals for vitamins B12, erythrocyte
folate, vitamin B6, and niacin number did not fall below
their respective reference values of 148 pmol/L, 370
nmol/L, 30 nmol/L, and 100, respectively. The 95% confidence
interval of 12.1 to 14.9 μmol/L for Hcy went
beyond its cut-off of 13.3 μmol/L. Based on the established
reference values, the prevalence of inadequate
micronutrient status varied from 1–35% depending on
the specific micronutrient examined (Table 1) and almost
half of the subjects had elevated Hcy.
A multiple linear regression showed vitamin B12 to be a
significant Hcy predictor (See Table 5). Figure 1 shows the
prevalence of Hcy elevations decreasing with increasing
cobalamin levels from 60% for B12 <148 pmol/L to 46.2%
for B12 between 148 and 221 pmol/L to 36.4% for B12
>221 pmol/L.
There was no significance when evaluating the main effect
of vitamin status on SMMSE categorizations (marked,
mild, normal). The prevalence of vitamin supplementation
did not significantly differ between the marked, mild
and normal SMMSE groups (See Table 2).
There were no significant differences in mean vitamin B12
and Hcy levels between users and non-users of drug therapy
(PPIs or H2-blockers): 304.6 (128.9) pmol/L and
15.2 (9.2) μmol/L for users, respectively; 300.5 (182.7)
pmol/L and 12.8 (4.2) μmol/L for non-users, respectively.
Vitamin supplementation between groups did not significantly
differ (See Table 3).
Vitamin supplement users had higher mean vitamin B12
(p < 0.0001) and erythrocyte folate (p < 0.05) concentrations
and lower Hcy (p < 0.01) than non-users (See Table
4). Although the folate status was significantly different,
the mean value for both groups was above the reference
value of 370 nmol/L.
The prevalence of inadequate vitamin status was greater
for those who were non-users of vitamin supplements
compared to users. The group difference was significant
for vitamin B12; among non-users 29/47 (61.7%) had B12
≤221 pmol/L compared to 2/28 (7.1%) among users, p <
0.0001 (See Table 4).
A multiple linear regression model showed creatinine (p
< 0.05) and vitamin B12 (p < 0.0001) as significant predictors
of the criterion homocysteine. Among the other nonsignificant
predictors were creatinine clearance, vitamin
B6, erythrocyte folate, and age (See Table 5). The amount of variance of the criterion explained by the combined
predictors was 41.2%.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of
B vitamin deficiencies in a long-term care population in
Ontario. Secondary objectives were to examine the relationship,
if any, between specific markers of vitamin adequacy
and: 1) the use of vitamin supplements, 2) the use
of drugs that alter gastric acid secretion, 3) cognitive function
as measured by performance on the Standardized
Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE).
In this study, the prevalence of folate, vitamin B6 and
niacin deficiency based on established reference values
were 1.3%, 5.3% and 26.7%, respectively. Among 177
institutionalized elderly (65–89 years) residing in Mexico,
Ortega et al [23] found 6.6% to have erythrocyte folate
<360 nmol/L. These authors also found a positive correlation
between folate intake and erythrocyte folate (r = 0.28,
p < 0.05). The fortification of many foods with folic acid
in North America may explain the more optimal folate
status in our subjects. In addition to dietary intake differences,
geographical differences related to the prevalence
of atrophic gastritis could also be considered. Atrophic
gastritis creates a low acid environment, which is conducive
to bacterial colonization and subsequent bacterial
synthesis of absorbable folic acid [25].
The prevalence of vitamin B6 ≤ 30 nmol/L at 5.3% was low
when compared to Joosten et al [26] who reported 51% of
286 hospitalized patients (61–97 years) living in Belgium,
Germany or the Netherlands, to have vitamin B6 <28.7
nmol/L. Various factors could be considered to explain
the difference in prevalence between the two studies
including differences in sample size and variable consumption
of nutrient rich foods. With respect to the latter,
residents of Ontario may be better nourished because of
habitual nutrient-rich food intake before and during hospitalization.
Niacin status has not been routinely examined in populations
of younger or older adults. Thus there are few reports
with which to compare our data. We report here a relatively
high prevalence of low niacin status compared to
the vitamins B6 and folate. The protective effect of niacin
nutriture in carcinogenesis [27] prompted researchers
towards developing a biomarker for niacin status. With
the finding of NAD content in erythrocytes as a sensitive
marker for niacin status in humans [28], niacin number
(NAD/NADP*100) became a convenient way to evaluate
the status of this micronutrient. A mean niacin number of
175 with a 95% confidence interval of 127 to 223 were
found among free-living healthy adults and metabolic
ward patients [24]. Fu et al [28] suggested a niacin
number below 100 (or ratio of NAD/NADP of 1.0) may
identify subjects at risk of niacin deficiency. Additionally,
analysis of niacin status in different populations revealed
15–20% are niacin deficient [29,30]. Our study found
26.7% at risk of niacin deficiency; a prevalence worthy of
greater attention.
Vitamin B12 deficiency is estimated to affect 10% to 15%
of people over the age of 60 [12]. Serum cobalamin is
most commonly used to diagnose deficiency although
some have argued it has poor diagnostic efficiency [31].
Pennypacker et al [18] argued that serum vitamin B12 was
insensitive for screening since similar numbers of geriatric
outpatients with low (<148 pmol/L) or low normal (148–
221 pmol/L) serum cobalamin had elevated metabolites
(>21.3 μmol/L Hcy and >376 nmol/L MMA), 62% and
56% respectively, which fell with cobalamin treatment.
Using identical low and low normal cobalamin references
ranges, Yao et al [32] reported elevated metabolites (>16
μmol/L Hcy and >270 nmol/L MMA) in 80% and 33% of
geriatric outpatients, respectively. For individuals 65 and
older with serum cobalamin below 221 pmol/L, the
authors recommended analysis of Hcy and MMA, especially
in those patients with unexplained hematological
and neuropsychiatric disorders [32]. Using serum B12 as
an estimate of B12 vitamin status, we found that fewer
than 7% of the hospitalized patients had levels that fell
below 148 pmol/L while 34.7% had levels between 148
and 221 pmol/L. Hcy elevations (>13.3 μmol/L) within
low (<148 pmol/L) and low normal (148–221 pmol/L)
cobalamin ranges were 60% and 46.2%, respectively.
Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA) – both
products of reactions requiring cobalamin – carry greater
diagnostic utility [31], although the cost of associated
assays may hamper their widespread use [31].
Among older people, increased medication use and gastrointestinal
changes are factors that affect micronutrient
absorption. For vitamins such as cobalamin, mechanisms
leading to potential deficiency due to malabsorption
include: 1) Inadequate cleavage of protein-bound B12 due
to hypoacidity (hypochlorhydria/achlorhydria), 2)
Decreased secretion of intrinsic factor (a vitamin B12 carrier
molecule), and 3) Gastric bacterial overgrowth (particularly
Escherichia coli which absorb vitamin B12). The
contributing factors to these gastrointestinal changes are
pernicious anemia and Helicobacter pylori infection, associated
with type A and type B atrophic gastritis, respectively
[12]. Atrophic gastritis, bacterial overgrowth and
medication use (proton pump inhibitors or H2-blockers)
are possible explanations. However, the mean B12 (304.6
and 300.5 pmol/L) and Hcy (15.2 and 12.8 μmol/L) levels
did not significantly vary between users and non-users
of drug therapy, respectively. It is thus unlikely these medications
would have induced low cobalamin and elevated
homocysteine states. Two factors should however be
acknowledged in evaluating the potential effect of gastric
acid lowering medications on vitamin B12 absorption: 1)
type of drug (PPI or H2-blocker) and 2) duration of medication
use. In a study comparing omeprazole (a PPI) with
H2-blocker therapy in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
patients [33], those treated with omeprazole (n = 111;
mean duration of 4.5 years) had significantly lower serum
B12 levels than those treated with H2-blockers (n = 20;
mean duration of 10 years). Omeprazole treatment
reduced acid secretion to significantly lower levels than
H2-blockers. Sustained hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria,primarily occurring in those treated with omeprazole, was
the only factor associated with reduced serum B12 levels.
To explain this difference researchers have noted that PPIs
cause prolonged, profound hypochlorhydria [34] whereas
the effect of H2 blockers is short lived – a transient
hypochlorhydria [35]. Among users of drug therapy (n =
22) in our study population, the majority used H2-blockers
(16/22 or 73%) versus PPIs (6/22 or 27%). Duration
of medication use was not considered in our study. Studies
have shown that prolonged treatment with PPIs (~3.5
years) [36] or H2-blockers [37] is needed to develop low
cobalamin levels. The potential for acute medication use
and the preferred administration of H2-blockers over PPIs
may thus be contributing to the lack of effect of these
medications on vitamin B12 and Hcy levels. Alternatively,
it is possible that the small number of subjects, particularly
in the drug-user category, may have obscured differences
between the two groups in our study. In future work
it would be valuable to have a larger number of drug using
subjects for comparison.
Joosten et al [25] estimated 51% of 286 hospitalized elderly
to have Hcy elevated >13.9 μmol/L. The only exclusion
criteria for this group of subjects were the presence of
life-threatening disease. Otherwise, subjects with common
geriatric diseases (vascular disease, dementia, diabetes
mellitus, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis) were included.
Among the factors that significantly correlated with
homocysteine were vitamin B12 (r = -0.27, p = 0.0001),
serum folate (r = -0.38, p = 0.0001), and creatinine clearance
(r = -0.44, p < 0.001) [24]. Within our sample population,
a 41.3% prevalence of Hcy >13.3 μmol/L was
found, the only significant predictors being vitamin B12 (p
< 0.0001) and creatinine (p < 0.05). If a relationship exists
between renal insufficiency and Hcy, it would be more
meaningful and reliable to use creatinine clearance over
creatinine as a marker of kidney function in older people.
This is because body mass declines with age and creatinine
clearance is determined irrespective of muscle mass.
Creatinine clearance was not a significant predictor of Hcy
in our study, implying a lack of effect of renal function on
Hcy levels. The significant relationship we found between
creatinine and Hcy is in line with what others have
observed [38-40].
The dependence of Hcy on vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and
folate as coenzymes in its metabolism explains the significance
of B vitamins in cases of elevated Hcy. In fact, Selhub
et al found inadequate plasma concentrations of one
or more B vitamins (plasma folate, vitamin B12, vitamin
B6) to contribute to 67% of high homocysteine cases (>14
μmol/L) in an elderly population [40]. As mentioned earlier,
of the three B vitamins, only vitamin B12 was a significant
predictor of Hcy in our study. Although vitamin B6
has shown weaker associations with Hcy, we expected
folate to be a significant predictor [40]. A possibility for
folate's non-significance is our selection of erythrocyte
folate over serum folate as a status indicator. Koehler et al
[41] showed serum Hcy to be negatively correlated with
all three folate status indicators (serum, erythrocyte, and
dietary intake). However, the authors commented that
Hcy corresponded best to short-term folate status as measured
by serum folate.
With respect to vitamin B6, evidence also exists to suggest
a lack of significance between Hcy and vitamin B6. Miller
et al [42] found no elevation in fasting plasma homocysteine
concentrations in studies with animals and
humans administered vitamin B6 deficient diets. Further,
Ubbink et al, showed a non-significant effect of a daily
pyridoxine dose on plasma homocysteine concentrations.
This was in contrast to folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation,
each of which significantly lowered elevated
Hcy [43].
Hcy concentrations increase with age [44-46] and the
majority of high Hcy cases in an older population can be
attributed to vitamin status [40]. A possible explanation
for the association between age and Hcy is an age-related
decline in enzymes involved in Hcy metabolism [46].
Similar to Koehler et al [41] (100 free living elderly, 68 to
96 years) who found vitamin supplement users to have a
significantly better micronutrient profile: 391 vs 292
pmol/L (vitamin B12), 1626 vs 1036 nmol/L (erythrocyte
folate), and 9.5 vs 11.2 μmol/L (Hcy), we found significantly
improved cobalamin (p < 0.0001), erythrocyte
folate (p < 0.05), and Hcy (p < 0.01) among supplement
users. Additionally, there was a significantly lower prevalence
of vitamin B12 levels ≤221 pmol/L among supplement
users. The composition of the multivitamin in our
study included 3 μg of vitamin B12 and 1 mg of vitamin B6.
Some patients were also given an intramuscular cobalamin
injection of 1000 μg. Considering the weaker effect of
vitamin B6 supplementation on Hcy levels [43] and the
absence of folic acid in the multivitamin preparation,
which has been shown to most effectively reduce Hcy
[42,22], it may be that cobalamin was responsible for Hcy
lowering in our study, reflecting an intracellular cobalamin
deficiency. Rasmussen et al showed a significant average
Hcy decrease with cobalamin supplementation alone
[46].
Up to 62% of institutionalized older people have dementia
[48], and in one study undernutrition was reported in
45.5% of a long-term care population (n = 200) [49]. A
multitude of factors – physical, psychological, social and
cultural – act on an aged population to reduce dietary
intake and alter nutrient metabolism [50]. This demographic
is thus at risk of malnutrition, a factor associated
with increased morbidity and morality [50]. A study by
Litchford et al [51] showed how cognitive dysfunction further
exacerbates the already vulnerable nutritional state of
an older population. Patients with senile dementia of the
Alzheimer's type had lower food intakes and higher
energy expenditures compared to cognitively normal
elders. A lack of macronutrient repletion in these dementia
patients, compounded by a potentially increased
micronutrient need (due to alterations in metabolic pathways)
could accelerate cognitive decline.
A number of conditions can cause dementia, an aetiology
related to nutrition being one of many possibilities.
Within our study population there was no association
between vitamin status and MMSE category (marked,
mild, normal). Whether poor dietary practices lead to cognitive
decline or that cognitive decline affects nutritional
status, perhaps mediated by metabolic alterations has not
been determined. Nevertheless, because poor dietary
practices have been shown to influence memory and
learning suggests the brain's vulnerability to diet.
To date, there have been no studies of a similar cross-sectional
nature conducted on a long-term care population
in Ontario. Assessing the prevalence of inadequate vitamin
or metabolite status is a starting point for understanding
the needs of an aging population and for
evaluating the usefulness of therapeutic interventions
related to improving vitamin intake. Based on our findings
and those of others, we recommend that clinical
intervention trials be initiated amongst older populations,
both in and out of the hospital setting, to determine
the usefulness of this strategy in combating the high frequency
of nutrient deficiencies in this population.
