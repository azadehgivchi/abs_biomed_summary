Background
Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is an ovarian insufficiency
syndrome before the age of 40 years affecting
approximately 1–2% women [26, 12]. It is characterized
by a continuous decline in ovarian function, and resulting
in an earlier cessation of menstruation than normal
[12]. Women with POI are faced with increased risk of
low chance of natural conception [4, 38], urogenital
atrophy [34], decrease in bone mineral density [3],
autoimmune and thyroid disease risk [11], cognitive dysfunction
[18], shortened life expectancy [30], and cardiovascular
disease [44, 15]. POI is a multifactorial disease [33].
Spontaneous POI is associated with genetic defects, autoimmunue
diseases, enzyme deficiency and environmental
factors, and iatrogenic POI occurs mainly due to surgical
intervention, chemotherapy and radiotherapy [18, 33].
There is ample evidence indicating that ovary is
damaged by autoimmunity through alteration of T-cell
subsets, T-cell-mediated injury, increasing of autoantibodyproducing
B-cells, decreasing of effector suppressor/cytotoxic
lymphocytes, and decreasing of natural killer cells [11].
It supports that antoimmune etiology exists in POI based
on the presence of lymphocytic oophoritis, association with
autoimmune disorders, and autoantibodies [11, 21]. A
number of studies have demonstrated that gut microbiome
play a key role in the autoimmune process [45]. Such as the
peptides generated by gut microbiota could induce immune
cells to become autoreactive and crossactivated [45].
Moreover, the dysbiosis of gut microbiome not only
can affect the activation of B lymphocytes and the production
of autoantibodies, but also induce the aberrant
activation of innate immune cells, which leads to the
upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines [45]. In
addition, increasing evidences have strongly suggested
that gut microbiome play an important role in POIassociated
symptoms, including autoimmune dysfunction
[39, 8], bone health [20, 29], cognitive and neurological
health [28, 14]. Gut microbiota and its metabolites also
have the ability to regulate inflammation pathway activation,
brain-gut peptide secretion and the destruction of
islet β-cell [46, 22]. All these studies indicate a relationship
may exist between the gut microbiome and POI.
In order to study the community profile of gut microbiome
in women with POI, and how the changes of gut
microbiota correlated with the sex hormones, 35 women
with POI and 18 healthy women were recruited in this study.
Sequencing of the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene in fecal
samples was performed to reveal the substantial differences
of gut microbiota between the POI subjects and controls.
Methods
Study cohort
A total of 35 women with spontaneous POI and 18
healthy women, aged 24 to 40 years, were recruited at the
Shenzhen Maternity&Child Healthcare Hospital from
August 2019 to September 2019. Spontaneous POI was
diagnosed and assessed according to the previously
reported [17], primary or secondary amenorrhea for at
least 4 months before 40 years, and with at least two instances
of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels
exceeded 40 IU/L with an interval of 4–6 weeks. All the
control women had normal ovarian function, without history
of menstrual dysfunction and infertility, with regular
menstruation and normal levels of FSH (< 10 IU/L).
Participants were excluded if with following situations:
non-46-XX karyotype, POI with family history, pregnancy,
tumor, chronic diarrhea, autoimmune diseases, use of
antibiotics/medications with the preceding 3 months, pelvic
surgery, gastrointestinal disease, active infections, body
mass index < 18.5 or > 23.9 kg/m2, smoking and chemo/
radiotherapy treatment. The study protocol was approved
by the ethics committee of Shenzhen Maternity&Child
Healthcare Hospital. Written informed consents were obtained
from all participants prior to enrollment. And clinical
characteristics were extracted from the health records.
Sampling
All participants were examined in the morning after > 8
h fasting. Fecal samples were collected using empty stool
collection tubes with an inbuilt sterile swab. Samples
were stored at − 80 C until further analysis.
DNA extraction and sequencing
DNA was extracted from fecal samples using QIAamp
DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification was conducted
using 338F forward primer 5′-ACTCCTACGG
GAGGCAGCAG-3′ and 806R reverse primer 5′-GGAC
TACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′ targeting the variable V3-
V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene. All samples were pooled
equally and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 machine
with 2 × 250 flow cell. Raw sequencing data in this
study were deposited into the NCBI’s Sequence Read
Archive database (SRA BioProject ID PRJNA615330).
Sequencing data analysis
Sequencing reads were assigned to each sample based
on dual-index barcodes using custom Perl script. Reads
were processed using the bioinformatics software
package QIIME2 (version 2019.10). Firstly, the reads
were imported to a QIIME2 artifact with command
“qiime tool import”. Then the reads were denoised
with command “qiime data 2 denoise-paired” to exclude
chimeric sequences and phiX sequences. Next,
taxonomy was assigned with command “qiime2
feature-classifier classify-sklearn” against Greengenes
(13_8 revision) database. Meanwhile, Shannon index
and weighted UniFrac distance were generated with
command “qiime phylogeny align-to-tree-mafft-fasttree”
and “qiime diversity core-metrics-phylogenetic”
at a sample depth of 1000. Principal coordinate
analysis (PCoA) based on weighted UniFrac distances
were also calculated.
Statistical analysis
Permutational multivariate analysis of variance
(PERMANOVA) was performed on weighted UniFrac
distance to investigate the differences of microbial
community structure between POI group and healthy
control group using package vegan (999 permutations) in
R software.
Statistical calculations were performed using R software,
and P value < 0.05 was considered significantly different.
Normality test was conducted using Shapiro-Wilk test.
Unpaired t-tests were used for comparisons of clinical
characteristics, indices of diversity between the two
groups. All these continuous data were expressed as mean
value ± standard deviation (SD). While Wilcoxon Rank
Sum tests were used for taxa comparisons at the phylum
and genus level. Partial correlation analysis was used to investigate
the relationships between microbes and clinical
characteristics in R packages “ggm” and “psych”.
Results
Study subject characteristics
Study subjects are all Han Chinese and live in Shenzhen
City. Their characteristics were summarized in Table 1.
All participants aged from 24 to 40 years old (average:
34.6 years old), accompanied with body mass index
(BMI) ranging from 18.6 to 23.9 kg/m2 (average: 21.2).
Statistical analysis demonstrated that there were no differences
at age, progesterone (P), prolactin (PRL) and
glucose (GLU) between women with and without POI.
In addition, women with POI had significantly higher
levels of BMI, FSH, luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone
(T) and FSH/LH ratio, but significantly lower levels
of estradiol (E2) and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH),
compared to healthy control women.
Overall community structure of POI gut microbiome
Sequencing was performed on the V3-V4 regions of 16S
rRNA to evaluate the community structure of gut microbiota
in women with and without POI. In total, 3,163,
487 usable reads (59,688 ± 11,095 reads per sample) were
obtained from all 53 samples, and the mean and median
sequence lengths were 411 and 410 bp separately. The
number of reads analyzed did not differ between POI
and control samples (60,943 ± 11,393 versus 57,247 ± 10,
326, P = 0.25), indicating comparable and adequate
sequencing coverage.
To explore the dissimilarity of gut microbiota between
the two groups, PCoA analysis was performed based on
the weighted UniFrac distance. The results showed the
subjects of the two groups did not separate (Fig. 1a)
(P = 0.16, PERMANOVA analysis with 999 permutations).
Further, POI subjects exhibited a higher Shannon
index without significant difference between the two
groups (4.97 ± 0.74 versus 4.71 ± 0.39, P = 0.09) (Fig. 1b).
The average weighted UniFrac value within subjects of
POI group was significantly higher than control group
(0.41 ± 0.13 versus 0.37 ± 0.11, P < 0.01) (Fig. 1c).
Characterizing the gut microbiome in POI group
Gut microbiome communities were dominated by phyla
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria
in both POI and control groups (Fig. 2a). And
Firmicutes was the predominant microbe, accounting for
65.35% ± 18.71 and 76.83% ± 14.90% in POI and control
group, respectively. The top 10 abundant genera in both
two groups were Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Blautia,
Clostridium, Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Megamonas,
Prevotella, Roseburia and Ruminococcus (Fig. 2b).
Compared to the control group, Bacteroides (13.42% ±
11.06% versus 8.45% ± 10.14%), Bifidobacterium (6.30% ±
11.76% versus 5.0% ± 8.84%), Megamonas (2.97% ± 12.90%
versus 1.37% ± 4.61%), Prevotella (4.09% ± 9.90% versus
2.37% ± 4.62%) increased, whereas Blautia (9.60% ± 7.37%
versus 11.72% ± 7.90%), Clostridium (1.61% ± 2.13% versus
4.31% ± 7.99%), Coprococcus (3.0% ± 2.93% versus 3.91% ±
4.12%), Faecalibacterium (13.35% ± 10.39% versus 21.65% ±
14.80%), Roseburia (3.63% ± 4.72% versus 3.84% ± 3.98%)
and Ruminococcus (3.73% ± 3.46% versus 4.75% ± 5.90%)
decreased in POI group.
Through Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests (Fig. 2c), phylum
Bacteroidetes (21.10% ± 14.01% versus 12.72% ± 11.96%,
P = 0.04), genera Butyricimonas (0.12% ± 0.16% versus
0.04% ± 0.08%, P = 0.03), Dorea (1.91% ± 1.72% versus
1.02% ± 0.83%, P = 0.049), Lachnobacterium (0.26% ±
0.72% versus 0.0011% ± 0.0047%, P = 0.007) and Sutterella
(0.34% ± 0.46% versus 0.08% ± 0.11%, P = 0.02) significantly
increased in POI women, compared to control
group. Whereas phylum Firmicutes (P = 0.03), genera
Bulleidia (0.0006% ± 0.0033% versus 0.0094% ± 0.021%,
P = 0.007) and Faecalibacterium (P = 0.04) significantly
decreased. Moreover, Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio
(0.41 ± 0.44 versus 0.20 ± 0.24, P = 0.03) in POI group
was significantly higher than control group.
Association between differential gut microbiota and
clinical characteristics
Pearson correlation analysis was performed after adjusting
for BMI to evaluate the association between the differential
microbes and serum hormones (Fig. 3). The results showed
that E2 level was significantly negatively correlated with relative
proportion of Bacteroidetes (R = − 0.41, P = 0.002) and
Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio (R = − 0.45, P < 0.01), while
positively correlated with Firmicutes (R = 0.30, P = 0.03) and
Faecalibacterium (R=0.28, P = 0.047). FSH was significantly
positively correlated with Bacteroidetes (R = 0.31, P = 0.02),
Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio (R=0.35, P = 0.01), and negatively
correlated with Firmicutes (R = − 0.28, P=0.04). LH
was significantly positively correlated with Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes
ratio (R=0.31, P = 0.02). FSH/LH ratio was significantly
positively correlated with the relative proportion of
Bacteroidetes (R = 0.35, P = 0.01), Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes
ratio (R = 0.34, P = 0.01), Dorea (R = 0.40, P < 0.01), and
negatively correlated with the relative proportion of Firmicutes
(R = − 0.30, P = 0.03) and Faecalibacterium (R = −
0.34, P = 0.01). AMH level was significantly correlated
with the relative proportion of Bacteroidetes (R = − 0.28,
P = 0.04), Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio (R = − 0.30, P =
0.03), Butyricimonas (R = − 0.31, P = 0.02) and Faecalibacterium
(R = 0.33, P = 0.02).
Discussion
This study aimed to reveal the overall composition of gut
microbiota in women with POI. As 15 to 30% of POI occurrences
are considered to be familial [12]. To rule out
genetic influences, all subjects recruited in this study were
without blood relationship. Besides genetic factor, autoimmunity
is an important etiology for POI, and gut microbiome
is important for the development and maturation
of the host immune system. In this study, the results
showed that all recruited subjects composed primarily of
phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria.
The sum relative abundance of Bacteriodetes and
Firmicutes accounted for more than 90%, which was consistent
with previous studies [42, 1]. A balance between
Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes is important to maintain intestinal
homeostasis [1], while a significant higher Bacteriodetes/
Firmicutes ratio was observed in POI subjects
compared to control subjects. Furthermore, the abundant
genera were Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Clostridium,
Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Megamonas, Prevotella,
Roseburia and Ruminococcus. Most of them play
important roles in the maintenance of host gastrointestinal
homeostasis and health [37, 25]. Notably, Bacteroides
fragilis produce some peptides similar to type II collagen
to induce crossreactive responses and to promote Th17
responses [45]. Similarly, some peptides produced by Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron and Roseburia intestinalis show
similarity with human Ro60 and β2-glycoprotein I, which
can trigger lupus-like symptoms [36, 16]. Bifidobacterium
adolescentis can induce and promote Th17 responses in
intestine [40]. Prevotella copri also can express antigens,
and promote Th17 responses [27]. While the relative
abundances of genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and
Prevotella all increased in POI group in this study. Moreover,
genera Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium,
Roseburia and Ruminococcus can produce
short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in human gut, such as
acetate, butyrate and succinate and so on [31, 35]. SCFAs
not only have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
properties through modulating Treg/Th17 cell balance,
but also can influence psychological function and cognitive
processes [35, 7]. Butyrate was reported to alleviate
antibody-induced arthritis in a natural killer T celldependent
manner [23]. While the relative abundances of
Blautia, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia and
Ruminococcus presented decrease trends, especially Faecalibacterium
decreased significantly in POI women in this
study. All theses changes of gut microbiome in POI group
might induce immunomodulating activity through certain
bacterial strains and their metabolites, which might be
related to autoimmunity, then affects the development of
POI.
Further, the gut microbiome is also found to be related
to POI-associated autoimmune disorders [8]. In this
study, there were significant decrease of Firmicutes, and
significant increase of Bacteroidetes and Bacteroidetes/
Firmicutes ratio in POI women. It was consistent with
the microbial community structure of type 1 diabetes
and systemic lupus erythematosus patients, with a low
proportion of Firmicutes, high proportion of Bacteroidetes
and Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio [10, 19]. Moreover,
genera Dorea and Sutterella were more abundant
in POI group. Increased proportion of Dorea is related
to multiple multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune condition
[6]. Sutterella is a mildly pro-inflammatory genus, and
its elevated level is associated with cognitive function
[43, 41]. As a SCFAs producing member with antiinflammatory
properties, Faecalibacterium decreased
significantly in POI group in this study, its low proportion
is also related to multiple sclerosis [5]. Butyrate
producer Butyricimonas [9] increased significantly in
POI group in this study. On the contrary, a low
abundance of Butyricimonas was observed in multiple
sclerosis fecal samples [13], that might be due to different
species under Butyricimonas. Type 1 diabetes,
systemic lupus erythematousus and multiple sclerosis,
and cognitive dysfunction are all closely related to POI.
Thus, the alterations of gut microbiome observed in this
study might be related to the development of POI
through affecting on the POI-associated diseases.
The gut microbiome has been shown to play an important
part in impacting estrogen level through the
secretion of β-glucuronidase, which could deconjugate
estrogen and affect related physiological process [32, 1].
In this study, significant lower level of E2 was observed
in POI subjects, and it was significantly correlated with
the proportion of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Faecalibacterium
by adjusting for BMI. And the FSH, LH and
AMH levels were also related to some microbes. It
indicated that the altered gut microbiota of POI was
associated with the sex hormones. Accumulating researches
indicates that estrogen regulate glucose and
lipid metabolism, bone formation and inflammatory response,
its reduction can impair estrogen-dependent
processes, triggering cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis
and so on [2, 24]. These symptoms are all related to
POI. Yet due to limited data in this study, the mechanism
under the relations between these microbes and sex
hormones is not clear.
POI leads to several complications, including decrease
in bone mineral density, autoimmune, thyroid disease
risk and cognitive dysfunction. This study not only
revealed the association between gut microbiota and
autoimmunity, but also the relationship between gut
microbiota and these complications. These indicated
that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota was related to the
development of POI discussed above. However, limited
sample size, participants from the same hospital and the
observation of association but not causality, large sample
size and multi-center are needed in the further studies.
Moreover, metagenome sequencing, measurements of
metabolites produced by gut microbiota, animal experiments
should also be considered to explore the potential
causal mechanism.
Conclusions
In summary, POI may cause by autoimmune etiology,
and the autoimmune process is affected by gut microbiome,
so we may consider some relationship may exist between
gut microbiome and POI.this study demonstrated an altered
gut microbial pattern in women with POI against
healthy controls, with an increase in Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium,
Megamonas, Prevotella and a decrease in Blautia,
Clostridium, Coprococcus, aecalibacterium, Roseburia and
Ruminococcu. And we also found that these changes of microbes
were closely related to serum hormones. This will
help us to make a foundation for revealing the interaction
between gut microbiota and POI certainly.
