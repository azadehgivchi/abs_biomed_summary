Background
Chronic heart failure (HF) affects roughly 5.7 million in 
the U.S. and results in $30.7 billion in medical spending 
each year [1, 2]. In addition, each year in the U.S. there 
are more than 1 million HF-related hospitalizations [3]. 
Treatment of HF include pharmacological therapies, 
such as beta blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and 
angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) [4], 
and device-based therapies, such as implantable cardiac 
defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy 
(CRT) [5]. For patients with more advanced stages of 
HF, treatment may include left ventricular assist devices 
(LVAD) and heart transplantation. A novel approach 
using baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) has shown 
promising results in clinical trials in these patients. BAT 
consists of device-based autonomic modulation, which 

generates a reduction of sympathetic outflow and an 
increase in parasympathetic activity, thereby rebalancing 
the autonomic nervous system [6]. This paper presents 
a cost impact model (CIM) of BAT + GDT versus GDT 
presented from the perspective of a U.S. health system or 
integrated delivery network. The model is based in part 
on the recently released 6-month clinical trial results 
associated with BAT administered via the BAROSTIM 
NEO System™ (CVRx, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) [7, 8]. The 
model also uses data abstracted from recent HF literature 
[9–12]. The working hypothesis is that BAT therapy is 
cost-saving; though it is a more resource-intensive in the 
short run, it results in better clinical outcomes over time, 
which in turn results in downstream cost savings for HF 
patients.
Several studies have demonstrated the safety and 
effectiveness of BAT in HF patients, as well as improved 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [7, 8, 13, 14]. BAT 
is delivered with an implantable device designed to mod-
ulate the body’s natural cardiovascular balance by send-
ing communicative signals to the brain via an electrode 
attached to the outside of the carotid artery, which in 
turn activates the process of balancing sympathetic and 
parasympathetic activities to regain homeostasis [15]. 
The device is primarily intended for NYHA Class III or 
Class II (with recent history of Class III) patients with 
LVEF ≤ 35% and a NT-proBNP < 1600  pg/mL. In past 
clinical studies of HF patients, BAT has been attributed 
to improvements in HRQoL, activity tolerance, NYHA 
functional class and NT-proBNP levels [7, 8, 16, 17].
The safety and efficacy of BAT in subjects with systolic 
HF was further evaluated in the recent Baroreflex Acti-
vation Therapy for HF (BeAT-HF) trial [7, 8] Six-month 
data show that patients receiving BAT plus guideline 
directed therapy (BAT + GDT) significantly reduced 
NT-proBNP levels by 21% (p = 0.002) over a 6-month 
period from a median baseline value of 688 pg/mL, while 
patients with GDT alone showed an increase in NT-
proBNP of 3% (p = n/s) from a median baseline value of 
784 pg/mL, a 25% relative reduction (p = 0.004). Patients 
receiving BAT + GDT also saw significant improvements 
in functional capacity (p < 0.001) as measured by 6-min 
hall walk (6MHW). Consistent with the reduction in 
NT-proBNP and increase in 6MHW, patients receiving 
BAT + GDT experienced improvements in quality-of-life 
metrics including Minnesota Living with Heart Failure 
(MLWHF) and EQ-5D.
Methods
The CIM, developed in Microsoft Excel 2016, is 
structured to mirror the BeAT-HF trial comparing 
BAT + GDT to GDT alone over a simulated 3-year 
period, using 6-month data from the BeAT-HF trial 
combined with existing literature. Following a simple 
decision tree framework, as shown in Fig.  1, expected 
costs for each group are calculated by multiplying rates 
and probabilities (trial or literature-based) with cost 
estimates from the literature. Key cost-related outcomes 
considered were BAT-specific serious adverse events, HF 
and non-HF CV hospitalizations, HF medication utiliza-
tion, and progression to LVAD or heart transplant. Cal-
culations are performed at four time periods: 6 months 
(corresponding to trial data and including initiation of 
BAT) and years 1, 2, and 3 post-BAT.
Rates of BAT-specific serious adverse events, progres-
sion to LVAD and heart transplantation, and rates of 
CV non-HF hospitalization (GDT only) are based on 
6-month BeAT-HF data. HF hospitalization rates for 
GDT are based on assumptions outlined within the sta-
tistical analysis plan for the BeAT-HF trial [18]. HF and 
CV non-HF hospitalization rates for BAT + GDT were 
calculated using a relative reduction estimated from 
changes in NT-proBNP levels (baseline to 6-month 
change) compared between in BAT + GDT and GDT 
alone. At 6  months, a 24.6% reduction in NT-proBNP 
between BAT + GDT and GDT alone was observed. A 
recent study demonstrated that a 25% reduction in NT-
proBNP results in an approximately 25% relative reduc-
tion in CV mortality and HF hospitalizations (i.e., a 
hazard ratio of 0.75) [12].
Clinical inputs
A summary of all clinical input parameters used in 
the model is shown in Table  1. HF medication utiliza-
tion is based on trial data for the first 6-months of the 
model, and it was assumed that subjects taking medi-
cation remained on that medication throughout each 
time interval. While medication utilization may decline 
for an individual patient (e.g., due to poor compliance), 
overall medication utilization is likely to increase over 
time as disease progresses and new drugs become avail-
able. Medication use in the GDT group was assumed to 
increase 4% each time period [11]; given disease progres-
sion, medication utilization was assumed to increase 
for both groups but at a slower rate in the BAT + GDT 
group. Based on recent market growth trends, it was 
assumed that the rate of ARNI utilization would grow by 
10% between each time period in GDT alone, and that 
the utilization rate of ARNI in BAT + GDT would also 
grow, but at a 20% slower rate than GDT alone. This is 
based on the BeAT-HF trial results suggesting lower utili-
zation of treatments like ARNI among patients receiving 
BAT + GDT compared to patient receiving GDT alone.
Significant CV non-HF hospitalization (i.e., arrhyth-
mias and other cardiac conditions) rates in GDT alone 
were based on the observed trial data and assumed to 

 
be constant over time, consistent with the assumptions 
in the BeAT-HF study (Table  1) [18]. The rates for HF 
and non-HF CV hospitalizations in BAT + GDT were 
estimated based on assumed relative reductions in hos-
pitalizations attributable to BAT. HF hospitalization rates 
within BAT + GDT were based on anticipated reduc-
tions of HF hospitalizations due to the improvement in 
the 6-month NT-proBNP observed from BAT. Zile et al. 
examined the relationship between one-month changes 
in NT-proBNP and the hazard ratio (HR) of time to first 
CV mortality and HF hospitalization, and found that a 
25% reduction in NT-proBNP was associated with a haz-
ard ratio (related to reduction in CV mortality and HF 
hospitalizations) of 0.75 between subjects with at least a 
25% reduction in NT-proBNP compared to those with-
out a 25% reduction [12]. This hazard ratio was applied as 
a 25% relative reduction in the number of HF hospitaliza-
tions in BAT + GDT compared to the GDT alone rates. 
The reduction in CV non-HF hospitalizations between 
BAT + GDT and GDT was also assumed to be 25%, con-
sistent with the methodology based on Zile et al.
Hospitalizations associated with LVAD and heart trans-
plantation were estimated differently for BAT + GDT 
versus GDT alone. The probability of BAT + GDT 
receiving an LVAD or a heart transplantation were both 
assumed to be 0.50% in years post-baseline. Based on 
disease progression effects, it was assumed that patients 
receiving BAT + GDT would have a low and constant 
probability of LVAD or heart transplant within the first 
3 years. Heart transplantation probabilities in GDT alone 
are calculated from the one-year probability of heart 
transplantation among HF patients reported in the litera-
ture (i.e., approximately 1.0% per year over 5 years) [10]. 
LVAD and heart transplantation were estimated for GDT 
alone by converting the initial probability into an instan-
taneous rate.

Cost inputs
All cost inputs were adjusted to 2018 U.S. dollars 
(Table 2). Cost of BAT was provided by the manufacturer 
and includes the cost of the device and the associated 
implantation surgery. Annual GDT costs were based on 
the monthly whole acquisition medication costs for HF 
patients, which reflect approximate payer reimburse-
ment amounts. Given the short time horizon, future 
costs are not discounted. The “other’ category includes 
a wide range of medications, such as amiodarone and 
hydralazine.
CV non-HF hospitalizations include cardiac arrhyth-
mias, cardiac arrest, hypotension, syncope, myocardial 
infarction, and unstable angina. The differential costs 
of each of these events were not reported for two rea-
sons: the cost differentials are very small and insignifi-
cantly different from one another; and as reported in 
Table  1, these events occur in very small numbers in 
the clinical trial population. The average CV non-HF 
hospitalization cost is based on two sources: for those 
events associated with a specific diagnosis-related 
group (MS-DRG), the mean 2016 national hospital cost 
was used (adjusted to 2018 dollars); alternatively, esti-
mates were based on the literature. LVAD and heart 
transplant costs were based on Medicare rates associ-
ated with relevant MS-DRG and procedure codes, cal-
culated as the sum of physician and anesthesiologist 
fees and expected LVAD readmission costs in addition 
to the cost of DRG 002 (heart transplant or implant of 
heart assist system without major complications).
Results
Table 3 showcases the expected costs per patient for both 
BAT + GDT and GDT alone, broken down by year for the 
first 3 years. In general, over time the annual costs associ-
ated with BAT + GDT are falling, while those associated 
with GDT alone increase. This results in a widening gap 
in per year costs in favor of BAT + GDT.

In the short term, treatment with BAT + GDT is 
more costly than GDT alone due to implantation costs, 
but over time the differential reverses, and BAT + GDT 
becomes less expensive than GDT alone (Table  4). 
After six months, corresponding to clinical trial results, 
BAT + GDT is $29,526 more expensive per patient than 
GDT alone, a differential almost completely attribut-
able to the costs associated with the BAT device and its 
implantation. The two treatment groups have equal pre-
dicted costs before year 3 but predicted costs at and after 
the 3-year mark are lower in BAT + GDT group com-
pared to GDT alone.
At 3 years, the predicted cumulative costs per patient 
for BAT + GDT was $80,565, while GDT alone costs 
were $90,086, representing a savings of $9521 using 
BAT + GDT. The initial cost of BAT made up roughly 
43% of the predicted costs per patient for BAT + GDT 
at 3  years, making it one of the largest cost drivers 
within this group. Medication utilization was also 
a major contributor, consisting of 41% of predicted 
costs. Within GDT, medication utilization and the cost 
of LVAD were the largest contributors to costs at the 
3-year mark, consisting of 63% and 20% of predicted 
costs, respectively. Costs savings for BAT + GDT 
accruing over time reflect the higher rates of dis-
ease progression, hospitalizations, and use of more 
resource-intensive treatments in GDT alone (Fig. 2).

hospitalizations, the model estimates substantially 
lower hospitalization rates in the years after BAT 
implantation (refer to Table  1), contributing to lower 
costs in the long run with BAT + GDT.
A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted on 
each of the cost parameters. To assess the sensitivity 
of the findings to key variable, cost parameters were 
increased and decreased by 20% to measure impact on 
total BAT + GDT costs. Main cost drivers were the ini-
tial cost of BAT, the cost of ARNI and other medica-
tions, and the cost of LVAD. Any change in the cost 
of BAT showed a proportional change in the total 
costs of BAT + GDT, while GDT alone remained con-
stant. At the 3-year mark, increasing the cost of BAT 
by 20% shows that savings with BAT + GDT fall to 
about $2621, while a decrease in the cost of BAT by 
20% increases savings associated with BAT + GDT 
over GDT alone by $16,421. When LVAD costs are 
varied, BAT + GDT remains roughly unchanged; a 20% 
decrease in the cost of LVAD results in higher GDT 
alone costs compared to BAT + GDT by $6,178.
A 20% decrease in ARNI costs alone shows sig-
nificant cost savings in GDT alone of greater than 
$6335, which is matched by a decrease in the costs in 
BAT + GDT of $3171. This result results in a differ-
ence of approximately $6358 in favor of BAT + GDT. 
Apart from the initial costs of BAT, GDT alone is 
more responsive to changes in the costs of model 
inputs. Given the lower complication and medication 
rates, costs within BAT + GDT vary less than those in 
GDT alone when subjected to increases and decreases 
in model input costs. The one-way sensitivity analy-
sis showed that at the 3-year mark, there was some 
variability in which treatment becomes more cost 
effective, however, BAT + GDT remains less sensitive 
to most changes in model inputs. Given the lower rates 
of utilizations, complications, and hospitalizations, the 
difference in costs between the treatment arms will 
continue to grow in favor of BAT + GDT as time goes 
on and changes in model inputs will have less impact 
on results after 3 years.
Discussion
Model results indicate that although there are larger ini-
tial costs associated with BAT + GDT, the economic ben-
efits become evident in the longer run. Savings associated 
with BAT + GDT begin before 3  years post-implanta-
tion and continued to grow over time; HF patients with 
reduced ejection fraction and NYHA class III have a 
3-year survival of 63.7%, implying that there will be con-
siderable savings for most patients [19]. Model savings 
are attributable primarily to three factors. First, trial 
results associated with BAT + GDT imply that there will 
be fewer CV hospitalizations (e.g., fewer adverse events 
requiring hospitalization for HF) among BAT + GDT. 
Second, clinical benefits of BAT + GDT reported in 
BeAT-HF imply that, based on existing clinical practice 
guidelines, the need for LVAD and heart transplant may 
in some cases be delayed. Third, BAT + GDT requires an 
initial device and implantation cost, which means that 
the initial cost when spread over a 3-year period is negli-
gible in terms of savings. It is also important to note that 
as more BAT clinical data become available, the meth-
odology and results will be updated to give a more long-
term (i.e., based on more than 6  months of trial data) 
representation of outcomes.

 
The findings are generally consistent with the work-
ing hypothesis. Without taking into consideration the 
improvements in quality of life, our analysis shows a great 
benefit to payers solely in terms of costs for BAT + GDT 
when compared with GDT alone. While there are cur-
rently no published cost-impact analyses for the treat-
ment of chronic heart failure with BAT, a preliminary 
cost-effectiveness analysis in the German setting in 
patients with advanced chronic heart failure demon-
strates that BAT is a cost effective treatment option, 
adding more evidence to support the use of BAT for 
the treatment of heart failure symptoms [20]. Although 
the model does not include a “budget impact” compo-
nent which would account for “uptake” of BAT + GDT 
in a hypothetical payer population, given medical device 
adoption complexity and the time it takes to widespread 
utilization, we do not believe that adding BAT treatment 
option to an insurance plan would have a large budget 
impact in the first few years of the therapy’s existence on 
the market.
Several ad hoc sensitivity analyses and data checks were 
conducted for this analysis and not overly sensitive to 
variation in individual parameters. First, HF hospitaliza-
tion estimates for time periods beyond 6  months were 
based on the BeAT-HF trial results pertaining to 6MHW. 
Though the prediction model was quite different (based 
on McCabe et al. [21]), the results were virtually identi-
cal. Second, model results were benchmarked with the 
existing literature. Within GDT alone, the model predicts 
a mean expected annual cost of $28,093 per person in the 
first year. In the U.S., annual HF costs are estimated to be 
about $26,000 (2018 dollars) but can also range as high 
as $40,000 depending on assumptions [22]. These ad hoc 
analyses suggest that the results of the CIM are consist-
ent with prior literature and across methodologies.
There are some potentially important limitations to 
note. First, the model relies extensively on preliminary 
6-month clinical data from BeAT-HF. These data, while 
showing significant results in key clinical endpoints, are 
still considered preliminary; the final release of the data 
will include longer intervals for most patients, which has 
the potential to alter some results reported within this 
study. Also, bias from using trial data may be present, 
as trial participants do not always represent patients 
treated, and benefits observed, in real world clinical 
practice. However, this is not expected to significantly 
limit the interpretation of the analysis, as the strength 
of preliminary trial data shows a robust relative benefit 
between the two randomized arms.
Second, the model assumes a 25% relative reduction in 
HF hospitalizations based on NT-proBNP levels to pre-
dict hospitalizations. Heart failure is a complex condition 
with many variables that impact outcomes, thus relying 
on NT-proBNP as a primary outcome indicator may be 
an oversimplification of reality. However, there is a sub-
stantial evidentiary base for NT-proBNP serving as a HF 
clinical endpoint predictive of future HF hospitalizations 
and health outcomes [23, 24]. Relative decreases in NT-
proBNP have been shown to correlate with reduced all-
cause mortality [25], heart failure hospitalization [12] 
and even left ventricular function [26]. The close asso-
ciation between reduced NT-proBNP and improved HF 
is sufficiently strong that management of individual HF 
patients according to their NT-proBNP levels has been 
proposed [27]. This is supported by a meta-analysis of 
11 trials involving 2000 HF patients [28]. Combined, the 
studies demonstrate that such an approach significantly 
reduces all-cause mortality and hospitalization for HF 
or cardiovascular disease. To provide additional insight, 
prediction models based on the 6MHW showed remark-
ably similar results.
Third, the model does not consider other important 
health outcomes, such as “quality-adjusted” life years 
(QALYs). We suspect, however, that this is a limitation 
that may disproportionately affect GDT rather than 
BAT + GDT, as quality measures such as MLWHF and 
HF markers such as NT-proBNP and 6MHW show 
clear benefits associated with BAT + GDT (relative to 
GDT alone) in the BeAT-HF clinical trial. Thus, it is 
likely that a full consideration of these endpoints would 
result in higher QALYs within BAT + GDT group. 
Finally, results have not been discounted to reflect the 
time value of clinical benefits and costs. However, given 
the relatively short timeline considered, discounting is 
unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the results.
Conclusion
Despite its initial device and implantation costs, 
BAT + GDT becomes the low-cost alternative treat-
ment less than 3  years from implantation, based on 
observed and extrapolated clinical trial outcomes. 
These results are broadly consistent with other studies 
of BAT. The long-run impact (greater than 3 years) of 
BAT + GDT results in cost savings while resulting in 
improvements in a variety of outcomes measures. As 
such, the CIM suggests that BAT is a promising treat-
ment option for patients with HF and a reduced LVEF 
who remain categorized in NYHA Class III or II (with 
a recent history of Class III) and have been on optimal 
standard-of-care pharmacological therapies. As BeAT-
HF outcome data past 6 months becomes available, the 
methodology and results of this model will be updated 
to give a more long-term representation of outcomes 
between BAT + GDT and GDT alone.
