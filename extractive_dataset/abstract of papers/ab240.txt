Background: Hypertension (HT) is associated with adverse outcomes in kidney transplant (KTX) recipients. Blunting
of physiological decrease in nighttime compared to daytime blood pressure (non-dipping status) is frequent in
this setting. However, weather non-dipping is independently associated with renal function decline in KTX patients is
unknown.
Methods: We retrospectively screened KTX outpatients attending for a routine ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
(ABPM) (T1) at a single tertiary hospital. Patients had two successive follow-up visits, 1 (T2) and 2 (T3) years later
respectively. Routine clinical and laboratory data were collected at each visit. Mixed linear regression models were
used with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as the dependent variable.
Results: A total of 123 patients were included with a mean follow-up of 2.12 ± 0.45 years after ABPM. Mean age
and eGFR at T1 were 56.0 ± 15.1 and 54.9 ± 20.0 mL/min/1.73m2 respectively. 61 patients (50.4%) had sustained HT
and 81 (65.8%) were non-dippers. In multivariate analysis, systolic dipping status was positively associated with eGFR
(p = 0.009) and compared to non-dippers, dippers had a 10.4 mL/min/1.73m2 higher eGFR. HT was negatively associated
with eGFR (p = 0.003).
Conclusions: We confirm a high prevalence of non-dippers in KTX recipients. We suggest that preserved systolic
dipping is associated with improved renal function in this setting independently of potential confounders, including
HT and proteinuria. Whether modification of dipping status by chronotherapy would preserve renal function remains
to be tested in clinical trials.
