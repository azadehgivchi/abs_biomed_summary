Background: Reports have proven that shorter door-to-needle time (DTN time) indicates better outcomes in AIS
patients received intravenous thrombolysis. Efforts have been made by hospitals and centers to minimize DTN time
in many ways including introducing a stroke nurse. However, there are few studies to discuss the specific effect of
stroke nurse on patients’ prognosis. This study aimed to compare consecutive AIS patients before and after the
intervention to analyze the effect of stroke nurse on clinical outcome of AIS patients.
Methods: In this retrospective study, we observed 1003 patients from November 2016 to December 2020 dividing
in two groups, collected and analyzed AIS patients’ medical history, clinical assessment information, important
timelines, 90 mRS score, etc. Comparative analysis and mediation analysis were also used in this study.
Results: A total of 418 patients was included in this study, and 199 patients were enrolled in the stroke nurse
group and 219 was in the preintervention group. Baseline characteristics of patients showed no significant
difference except there seems more patients with previous ischemic stroke history in the group of stroke
nurse. (p = 0.008). The median DTN time significantly decreased in the stroke nurse group (25 min versus
36 min, p < 0.001) and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the 90-day mRS clinical outcome
significantly improved in the stroke nurse group (p = 0.001). Mediation analysis indicated the reduction of DTN
time plays a partial role on the 90 days mRS score and the stroke nurse has some direct effect on the
improvement of clinical outcome (p = 0.006).
Conclusions: The introduction of stroke nurse is beneficial to clinical outcome of AIS patients and can be
use of reference in other hospitals or centers.
