Background: Bleeding after thyroidectomy occurs due to violent coughing during emergence. Dexmedetomidine
is helpful for the smooth emergence and suppression of cough. The purpose of the present study was to compare
the effects of dexmedetomidine on postoperative bleeding after thyroidectomy.
Methods: Randomized, double-blind, controlled trials were conducted in female patients (ASA I–II, aged 20 to 60
years). The patients were randomly allocated into two groups. Approximately 15 min before the end of the surgery,
dexmedetomidine was administered (0.6 μg/kg/h) without a loading dose in group D (n = 69), and normal saline
was administered in group S (n = 70) at the same infusion rate. Hemodynamic data, coughing reflex, extubation
time, Ramsay sedation scale (RSS), and recovery time were assessed during the administration of the study drugs
and recovery from anesthesia. The amount of postoperative hemorrhage was measured for 3 days.
Results: Data from a total of 139 patients were analyzed. The incidence of severe cough was significantly lower in
group D than in group S (4.3 % vs. 11.5 %, P = 0.022). The emergence agitation in the postanesthetic care unit was
significantly lower in group D than in group S (P = 0.01). Postoperative bleeding was significantly lower in group D
than in group S until the second postoperative day (P = 0.015).
Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine can be helpful in decreasing bleeding after thyroidectomy by reducing coughing
and emergence agitation.
