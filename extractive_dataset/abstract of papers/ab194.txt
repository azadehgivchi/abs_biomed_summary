Background: Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS, OMIM#606232), or 22q13 deletion syndrome, is a rare genetic
disorder caused by deletion of the distal long arm of chromosome 22 with a variety of clinical features that display
considerably heterogeneous degrees of severity. The SHANK3 gene is understood to be the critical gene for the
neurological features of this syndrome.
Case presentation: We describe one pair of boy-girl twins with a 22q13 deletion not involving the SHANK3 gene.
Interestingly, the clinical and molecular findings of the two patients were identical, likely resulting from germline
mosaicism in a parent. The boy-girl twins showed intellectual disability, speech absence, facial dysmorphism,
cyanosis, large fleshy hands and feet, dysplastic fingernails and abnormal behaviors, and third-generation
sequencing showed an identical de novo interstitial deletion of 6.0 Mb in the 22q13.31-q13.33 region.
Conclusions: Our case suggests that prenatal diagnosis is essential for normal parents with affected children due
to the theoretical possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Our results also indicated that other genes located in
the 22q13 region may have a role in explaining symptoms in individuals with PMS. In particular, we propose that
four candidate genes, CELSR1, ATXN10, FBLN1 and WNT7B, may also be involved in the etiology of the clinical
features of PMS. However, more studies of smaller interstitial deletions with 22q13 are needed to corroborate our
hypothesis and better define the genotype-phenotype correlation. Our findings contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of PMS.
