Background: Emerging research shows a high prevalence of fatigue and sleep problems among university
students. The present study evaluates the effects of regular aerobic exercise on sleep quality and fatigue level
among female students (ages 18â€“26) who reside in dormitories.
Methods: This quasi-experimental study involving 67 participants consisted of one experimental group (i.e.,
assigned aerobic exercise) and one control group (i.e., not assigned aerobic exercise). Participants in the
experimental group received three one-hour sessions aerobic exercise weekly ranging from mild to moderate
intensity for eight-week. Sleep quality and fatigue level were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
(PSQI) and standard Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), respectively. These variables were assessed at
baseline, week four, and week eight of the study.
Results: After four and 8 weeks of the intervention, participants in the aerobic group showed improvement in the
score of sleep quality (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and its components (except for sleep duration after 4
weeks intervention). Also, aerobic exercise resulted in a significant reduction of the total score of fatigue and its
dimensions in weeks four and eight, compared to the control group (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Four-week aerobic exercise with mild intensity had no significant effect on sleep duration. Conversely,
intensified aerobic exercise for 8 weeks influenced all components of sleep quality.
