Background: At present, the proportion of undiagnosed diabetes in Chinese adults is as high as 15.5%. People
with diabetes who are not treated and controlled in time may have various complications, such as cardiovascular
and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetic foot disorders, which not only seriously affect the quality of life of people
with diabetes but also impose a heavy burden on families and society. Therefore, prevention and control of type 2
diabetes is of great significance.
Methods: We constructed a logistic regression model, a neural network model and a decision tree model to analyse
the risk factors for type 2 diabetes and then compared the prediction accuracy of the different models by calculating
the area under the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve and back-inputting the data into the model.
Results: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in 4177 subjects who were not diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was 9.31%.
The most influential factors associated with type 2 diabetes were triglyceride (TG) ≥ 1.17 mmol/L (odds ratio (OR) =2.233),
age ≥ 70 years (OR = 1.734), hypertension (OR = 1.703), alcohol consumption (OR = 1.674), and total cholesterol≥5.2mmol/
L (TC) (OR = 1.463). The prediction accuracies of the three prediction models were 90.8, 91.2, and 90.7%, respectively, and
the areas under curve (AUCs) were 0.711, 0.780, and 0.698, respectively. The differences in the AUCs after back
propagation (BP) of the neural network model, logistic regression model and decision tree model were statistically
significant (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: BP neural networks have a higher predictive power for identifying the associated risk factors of type 2
diabetes than the other two models, but it is necessary to select a suitable model for specific situations.
