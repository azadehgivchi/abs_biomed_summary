Background: Asthma is a chronic infammatory disorder of the airways involving many diferent factors. This study
aimed to screen for the critical genes using DNA methylation/CpGs and miRNAs involved in childhood atopic asthma.
Methods: DNA methylation and gene expression data (Access Numbers GSE40732 and GSE40576) were down‑
loaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Each set contains 194 peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC) samples of 97 children with atopic asthma and 97 control children. Diferentially expressed genes (DEGs) with
DNA methylation changes were identifed. Pearson correlation analysis was used to select genes with an opposite
direction of expression and diferences in methylation levels, and then Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed. Protein–protein interaction network
and miRNA–target gene regulatory networks were then constructed. Finally, important genes related to asthma were
screened.
Results: A total of 130 critical DEGs with DNA methylation changes were screened from children with atopic asthma
and compared with control samples from healthy children. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis found that
critical genes were primarily related to 24 GO terms and 10 KEGG pathways. In the miRNA–target gene regulatory
networks, 9 KEGG pathways were identifed. Analysis of the miRNA–target gene network noted an overlapping KEGG
signaling pathway, hsa04060: cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, in which the gene CCL2, directly related to
asthma, was involved. This gene is targeted by eight asthma related miRNAs (hsa-miR-206, hsa-miR-19a, hsa-miR-9,hsamiR-22, hsa-miR-33b, hsa-miR-122, hsa-miR-1, and hsa-miR-23b). The genes IL2RG and CCl4 were also involved in this
pathway.
Conclusions: The present study provides a novel insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of childhood
atopic asthma.
