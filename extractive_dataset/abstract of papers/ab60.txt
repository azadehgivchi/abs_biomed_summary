Background: In the recent years, an increasing number of patients with multiple comorbidities (e.g. coronary artery
disease, diabetes, hypertension) presents to the operating room. The clinical risk factors are accompanied by
underlying vascular-endothelial dysfunction, which impairs microcirculation and may predispose to end-organ
dysfunction and impaired postoperative outcome. Whether preoperative endothelial dysfunction identifies patients
at risk of postoperative complications remains unclear. In this prospective observational study, we tested the
hypothesis that impaired flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a non-invasive surrogate marker of endothelial function,
correlates with Days at Home within 30 days after surgery (DAH30). DAH30 is a patient-centric metric that captures
postoperative complications and importantly also hospital re-admissions.
Methods: Seventy-one patients scheduled for major abdominal surgery were enrolled. FMD was performed preoperatively
prior to major abdominal surgery and patients were dichotomised at a threshold value of 10%. FMD
was then correlated with DAH30 (primary endpoint) and postoperative complications (secondary endpoints).
Results: DAH30 did not differ between patients with reduced FMD and normal FMD (14 (4) (median (IQR)) vs. 15
(8), P = 0.8). Similary, no differences between both groups were found for CCI (normal FMD: 21 (30) (median (IQR)),
reduced FMD: 26 (38), P = 0.4) or frequency of major complications (normal FMD: 7 (19%) (n (%)), reduced FMD: 12
(35%), P = 0.12). The regression analyses revealed that FMD in combination with ASA status and surgery duration
had no additional significant predictive effect for DAH30, CCI or Clavien-Dindo score.
Conclusion: FMD does not add predictive value with regards to DAH30, CCI or Clavien-Dindo score within our
study cohort of patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
