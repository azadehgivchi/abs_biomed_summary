Background: The lung allocation system in the U.S. prioritizes lung transplant candidates based on estimated preand
post-transplant survival via the Lung Allocation Scores (LAS). However, these models do not account for
selection bias, which results from individuals being removed from the waitlist due to receipt of transplant, as well
as transplanted individuals necessarily having survived long enough to receive a transplant. Such selection biases
lead to inaccurate predictions.
Methods: We used a weighted estimation strategy to account for selection bias in the pre- and post-transplant
models used to calculate the LAS. We then created a modified LAS using these weights, and compared its
performance to that of the existing LAS via time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves,
calibration curves, and Bland-Altman plots.
Results: The modified LAS exhibited better discrimination and calibration than the existing LAS, and led to changes
in patient prioritization.
Conclusions: Our approach to addressing selection bias is intuitive and can be applied to any organ allocation
system that prioritizes patients based on estimated pre- and post-transplant survival. This work is especially relevant
to current efforts to ensure more equitable distribution of organs.
