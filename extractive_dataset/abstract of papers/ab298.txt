Background: Dental fear is associated with the experience of prior dental treatment and avoidance of dental visits. It
remains unclear if individuals show an intention of avoidance (IA) towards treatments that they have not received (i.e.,
non-experienced dental treatment). The study aims to investigated (a) if individuals showed an increased fear and IA
to non-experienced, compared to experienced dental treatment, and (b) if fear and IA to non-experienced treatment
is associated with dental anxiety.
Methods: Fear/IA of 12 common conditions of dental treatment of 402 adults were investigated. If subjects have
experienced the condition, fear and IA were assessed based on subjects’ prior experience (i.e., ExpFear/ExpIA). If they
have not experienced the condition, fear and IA were assessed based on their anticipation (i.e., NExpFear/NExpIA).
Trait dental anxiety was assessed using the Index of Dental Anxiety and Fear (IDAF-4C+).
Results: (A) NExpFear and NExpIA were significantly higher than ExpFear and ExpIA, respectively. (B) The IDAF-
4C+ scores are positively correlated with NExpFear/NExpIA and negatively correlated with the magnification of fear
(i.e., the discrepancy in the fear/IA of non-experienced vs. experienced conditions). (C) The condition ‘extraction of a
wisdom tooth’ and ‘root canal treatment’ showed the highest ratings on NExpFear.
Conclusions: Individuals may develop a high degree of fear and IA of the treatment they have not received. Trait
dental anxiety plays a key role in the fear of non-experienced treatment.
