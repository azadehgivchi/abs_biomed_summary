Abstract
Background: A significant proportion of newly diagnosed patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)
have metastasis and eventually die of the disease, necessitating the exploration of novel biomarkers for early
detection of cSCC aggressiveness, risk assessment and monitoring. Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) has been
implicated in cSCC pathogenesis. Serum MMP-13 levels have been shown to predict survival in patients with
esophageal SCC, but their diagnostic value for cSCC has not been explored.
Methods: We conducted a case-control study to examine serum MMP-13 as a biomarker for cSCC. Patients with
cSCC undergoing surgical resection and health controls undergoing plastic surgery were recruited. ELISA for
measurement of serum MMP-13 and immunohistochemistry for detection of tissue MMP-13 were performed, and
the results were compared between the case and the control group, and among different patient groups. ROC
curve analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic value of serum MMP-13 levels.
Results: The ratio of male to female, and the age between the case (n = 77) and the control group (n = 50) were not
significantly different. Patients had significantly higher serum MMP-13 levels than healthy controls. Subjects with stage
3 cSCC had markedly higher serum MMP-13 levels than those with stage 1 and stage 2 cSCC. Patients with invasive
cSCC had remarkably higher serum MMP-13 than those with cSCC in situ. Post-surgery serum MMP-13 measurement
was done in 12 patients, and a significant MMP-13 decrease was observed after removal of cSCC. Tumor tissues had a
remarkably higher level of MMP-13 than control tissues. Serum MMP-13 predicted the presence of invasive cSCC with
an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI [0.78 to 0.95]) for sensitivity and specificity of 81.7 and 82.4%, respectively for a cut-off value of
290 pg/mL. Serum MMP-13 predicted lymph node involvement with an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI [0.88 to 0.99]) for
sensitivity and specificity of 93.8 and 88.5%, respectively for a cut-off value of 430 pg/mL.
Conclusion: Serum MMP-13 might serve as a valuable biomarker for early detection of cSCC invasiveness and
monitoring of cSCC progression.
