Background: Cervical cancer screening in sub-Saharan countries relies on primary visual inspection with acetic
acid (VIA). Primary human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening is considered a promising alternative. However,
the implementation and real-life effectiveness of this strategy at the primary-care level in limited-resource contexts
remain under explored. In Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, free HPV-based screening was implemented in 2019 in two
primary healthcare centers. We carried out a process and effectiveness evaluation of this intervention.
Methods: Effectiveness outcomes and implementation indicators were assessed through a cohort study of screened
women, observations in participating centers, individual interviews with women and healthcare providers and monitoring
reports. Effectiveness outcomes were screening completeness and women’s satisfaction. Logistic regression
models and concurrent qualitative analysis explored how implementation variability, acceptability by women and the
context affected effectiveness outcomes.
Results: After a 3-month implementation period, of the 350 women included in the cohort, 94% completed the
screening, although only 26% had their screening completed in a single visit as planned in the protocol. The proportion
of highly satisfied women was higher after result disclosure (95%) than after sampling (65%). A good understanding
of the screening results and recommendations increased screening completeness and women’s satisfaction, while
time to result disclosure decreased satisfaction. Adaptations were made to fit healthcare workers’ workload.
Conclusion: Free HPV-based screening was successfully integrated within primary care in Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso, leading to a high level of screening completeness despite the frequent use of multiple visits. Future implementation
in primary healthcare centers needs to improve counseling and reduce wait times at the various steps of the
screening sequence.
