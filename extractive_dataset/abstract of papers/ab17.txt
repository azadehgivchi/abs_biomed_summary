Background: Persistent pancreatic leakage (PL) due to disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS) is associated
with severe morbidity and mortality and it usually treated with internal drainage. However, in cases without localized
fistula formation, internal drainage is challenging to perform. We report an original one-stage surgical approach for
nonlocalized persistent PL, namely, the “intentional internal drainage tube method”.
Case presentation: A 49-year-old woman whose main pancreatic duct was penetrated during endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography experienced severe PL. Peritoneal lavage and a second operation involving central
pancreatectomy failed to relieve the symptoms, and nonlocalized PL persisted due to DPDS. Although we attempted
a radical resection of the pancreatic remnants as a third strategy, the highly inflamed tissue and massive bleeding
prevented the completion of the procedure. We sutured the pancreatic head margin and performed a pancreaticojejunostomy
to the distal margin. Because these two cut margins could possibly be the source of the persistent PL, we
created a hole at the Roux-en-Y jejunal limb, and a silicone drainage tube was inserted into the peritoneal space via
this hole. Postoperatively, we continuously suctioned the intentional internal drainage tube, and the residual PL cavity
gradually diminished. Even after removal of the tube, the residual PL drained internally into the jejunum through this
hole.
Conclusions: We present this intentional internal drainage tube method as a novel alternative approach for the
management of nonlocalized PL consequential of DPDS. Due to the simplicity and minimally invasive nature of this
method, we propose this technique may also be used to treat various types of nonlocalized persistent PL or be used
prophylactically for central pancreatectomy.
