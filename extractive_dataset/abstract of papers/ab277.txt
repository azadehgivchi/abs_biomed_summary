Background: Micronutrients have been implicated as an important factor in regulating various metabolic processes
and thus playing a role in the aetiology of obesity. Many studies have been conducted worldwide that clearly show
a direct link between obesity and micronutrient deficiencies. The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional
status of overweight and obese Australian adults to see if there were any associations between BMI and serum
micronutrient levels.
Methods: Baseline serum micronutrient data of overweight and obese individuals with a body mass index (BMI)
between 25 and 40 kg/m2 and aged between 18 and 65 years was compared to the clinical micronutrient reference
ranges for associations between BMI and micronutrient status.
Results: There were significant negative associations between BMI and serum vitamin D (p = 0.044), folate (p = 0.025),
magnesium (p = 0.010) and potassium (p = 0.023).
Conclusions: Overweight and obesity appears to impact on the bioavailability and utilisation of micronutrients with
absorption, excretion, storage/distribution (fat sequestering, tissue dispersion), metabolism (catabolic losses, possibly
oxidative), increased physiologic requirements, and lower absolute total dietary intake being the current theory for
observed differences. While vitamins D, folate, magnesium and potassium showed a negative relationship to BMI, other
micronutrients did not. This may be explained by the fortification of certain processed foods, or the possibility of
overweight and obese people eating more to satisfy their nutritional requirements.
