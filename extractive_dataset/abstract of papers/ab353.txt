Background: The present study considers a measure of positive body image, the Body Appreciation Scale-2, which
assesses acceptance and/or favourable opinions towards the body (BAS-2). Potential variations of the psychometric
properties of the scale across males and females, as well as across its different items invite for further investigation. The
present study contributes to this area of knowledge via the employment of gender Measurement Invariance (MI) and
Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses.
Methods: A group of 386 adults from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United
States of America (USA) were assessed online (N = 394, 54.8% men, 43.1% women, Mage = 27.48; SD = 5.57).
Results: MI analyses observed invariance across males and females at the configural level, and non-invariance at the
metric level. Further, the graded response model employed to observe IRT properties indicated that all items demonstrated,
although variable, strong discrimination capacity.
Conclusions: The items showed increased reliability for latent levels of âˆ“ 2 SD from the mean level of Body Appreciation
(BA). Gender comparisons based on BAS-2 should be cautiously interpreted for selected items, due to demonstrating
different metric scales and same scores indicating different severity. The BAS-2 may also not perform well for
clinically low and high BA levels. Thus, it should optimally be accompanied by clinical interviews for formal assessment
in such cases.
