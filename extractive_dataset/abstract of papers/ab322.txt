Background: Poor quality medicines have serious implications for public health. The aim of this study was to
explore the quality of the antidiabetic pioglitazone, using samples collected in China and Myanmar, and samples
purchased online.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we examined samples (n = 163) collected from hospitals in Shanghai, China
in 2012 (n = 44), products purchased via the internet and imported into Japan in 2013 (n = 59), and samples
purchased in shops in Yangon, Myanmar in 2015 (n = 60). Collected samples were subjected to visual inspection,
authenticity investigation and quality testing (potency, content uniformity and dissolution test) by highperformance
liquid chromatography. Samples were rated as compliant or non-compliant based on the relevant
pharmacopoeial acceptance criteria.
Results: Visual inspection of all samples revealed compliant products. However, responses from manufacturers
during authenticity investigation were poor. Among the n = 44 samples from China, one was non-compliant in the
potency test. Among the n = 59 samples personally imported into Japan, 38% of generic samples were found to be
non-compliant. In Myanmar, 13.3% of samples were non-compliant. Non-compliant samples predominantly failed in
the dissolution test. All non-compliant samples were generic.
Conclusions: Despite the apparent satisfactory outcome on the samples from China, pioglitazone samples
collected in Myanmar and purchased online for personal import into Japan included many substandard products,
which failed quality assessment predominantly because of poor dissolution. Internet providers did not comply with
Japanese regulations in various respects.
