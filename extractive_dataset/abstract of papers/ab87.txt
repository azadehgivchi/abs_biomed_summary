Background: This study assessed the sociodemographic, functional, and clinical determinants of antithrombotic
treatment in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) attended in the internal medicine setting.
Methods: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted in NVAF patients who attended internal medicine
departments for either a routine visit (outpatients) or hospitalization (inpatients).
Results: A total of 961 patients were evaluated. Their antithrombotic management included: no treatment (4.7%),
vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (59.6%), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (21.6%), antiplatelets (6.6%), and antiplatelets
plus anticoagulants (7.5%). Permanent NVAF and congestive heart failure were associated with preferential use of oral
anticoagulation over antiplatelets, while intermediate-to high-mortality risk according to the PROFUND index was
associated with a higher likelihood of using antiplatelet therapy instead of oral anticoagulation. Longer disease duration
and institutionalization were identified as determinants of VKA use over DOACs. Female gender, higher education,
and having suffered a stroke determined a preferential use of DOACs.
Conclusions: This real-world study showed that most elderly NVAF patients received oral anticoagulation, mainly
VKAs, while DOACs remained underused. Antiplatelets were still offered to a proportion of patients. Longer duration
of NVAF and institutionalization were identified as determinants of VKA use over DOACs. A poor prognosis according
to the PROFUND index was identified as a factor preventing the use of oral anticoagulation.
