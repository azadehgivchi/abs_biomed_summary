Abstract
Background: Persistent somatic symptoms (PSS) are common in primary care and often accompanied by an increas‑
ing disease burden for both the patient and healthcare. In medical practice, PSS is historically considered a diagnosis
by exclusion or primarily seen as psychological. Besides, registration of PSS in electronic health records (EHR) is unam‑
biguous and possibly does not refect classifcation adequately. The present study explores how general practitioners
(GPs) currently register PSS, and their view regarding the need for improvements in classifcation, registration, and
consultations.
Method: Dutch GPs were invited by email to participate in a national cross-sectional online survey. The survey
addressed ICPC-codes used by GPs to register PSS, PSS-related terminology added to free text areas, usage of PSSrelated syndrome codes, and GPs’ need for improvement of PSS classifcation, registration and care.
Results: GPs (n=259) were most likely to use codes specifc to the symptom presented (89.3%). PSS-related termi‑
nology in free-text areas was used sparsely. PSS-related syndrome codes were reportedly used by 91.5% of GPs, but
this was primarily the case for the code for irritable bowel syndrome. The ambiguous registration of PSS is reported as
problematic by 47.9% of GPs. Over 56.7% of GPs reported needing additional training, tools or other support for PSS
classifcation and consultation. GPs also reported needing other referral options and better guidelines.
Conclusions: Registration of PSS in primary care is currently ambiguous. Approximately half of GPs felt a need for
more options for registration of PSS and reported a need for further support. In order to improve classifcation, regis‑
tration and care for patients with PSS, there is a need for a more appropriate coding scheme and additional training
