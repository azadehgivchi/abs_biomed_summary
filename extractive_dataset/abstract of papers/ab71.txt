Abstract
Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent lymphoid neoplasm among adults,and
approximately 30–40% of patients will experience relapse while 5–10% will suffer from primary refractory disease
caused by different mechanisms, including treatment-induced resistance. For refractory and relapsed DLBCL
(rrDLBCL) patients, early detection and understanding of the mechanisms controlling treatment resistance are of
great importance to guide therapy decisions. Here, we have focused on genetic variations in immune surveillance
genes in diagnostic DLBCL (dDLBCL) and rrDLBCL patients to elaborate on the suitability of new promising
immunotherapies.
Methods: Biopsies from 30 dDLBCL patients who did not progress or relapse during follow up and 17 rrDLBCL
patients with refractory disease or who relapsed during follow up were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing,
including matched individual germline samples to include only somatic genetic variants in downstream analysis of
a curated list of 58 genes involved in major immune surveillance pathways.
Results: More than 70% of both dDLBCLs and rrDLBCLs harbored alterations in immune surveillance genes, but
rrDLBCL tumor samples have a lower number of genes affected compared to dDLBCL tumor samples. Increased
gene mutation frequencies in rrDLBCLs were observed in more than half of the affected immune surveillance genes
than dDLBCLs.
Conclusion: Genetic variants in the antigen-presenting genes affect a higher number of rrDLBCL patients
supporting an important role for these genes in tumor progression and development of refractory disease and
relapse.
