Background: In aging, muscle stiffness is considered as one of the factors associated with the reduction of force
generation capability. There have been inconsistent findings on age-related alteration in the passive stiffness of
quadriceps muscle in the female adults. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of aging on the shear
moduli of the superficial muscle heads of the quadriceps and to explore its relationship with knee extension force.
Methods: Passive shear moduli of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), and vastus medialis (VM) were measured
at rest using shear wave elastography in 20 young and 20 senior female adults. Measurements were repeated
at four knee joint positions, that is, 30°, 60°, 90°, and 105° of knee flexion. Maximal isometric voluntary knee extension
force was assessed at 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion.
Results: As per our findings, senior adults were determined to have significantly higher passive muscle shear moduli
in the RF (by 34% – 68%; all p < 0.05) and the VL muscle heads (by 13%–16%, all p < 0.05) at and beyond 60° of knee
flexion. Age-related increase in the VM was evident at 105° knee flexion (by11%, p = 0.020). The RF shear modulus was
negatively correlated to the maximal isometric voluntary contraction force measured at 60° (r = − 0.485, p = 0.030) in
senior adults.
Conclusions: Senior female adults had greater passive stiffness at the superficial muscle heads of the quadriceps
muscles when measured at long muscle length. Among the senior female adults, the passive stiffness of RF has been
determined to have a negative association with the knee extensor force only at 60° knee flexion. No significant association
was noted for other angles and muscles.
