Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the leading cause of death among men
diagnosed with prostate cancer. Piperlongumine (PL) is a novel potential anticancer agent that has been
demonstrated to exhibit anticancer efficacy against prostate cancer cells. However, the effects of PL on DNA
damage and repair against CRPC have remained unclear. The aim of this study was to further explore the
anticancer activity and mechanisms of action of PL against CRPC in terms of DNA damage and repair processes.
Methods: The effect of PL on CRPC was evaluated by MTT assay, long-term cell proliferation, reactive oxygen
species assay, western blot assay, flow cytometry assay (annexin V/PI staining), Î²-gal staining assay and DAPI
staining assay. The capacity of PL to inhibit the invasion and migration of CRPC cells was assessed by scratchwound
assay, cell adhesion assay, transwell assay and immunofluorescence (IF) assay. The effect of PL on DNA
damage and repair was determined via IF assay and comet assay.
Results: The results showed that PL exhibited stronger anticancer activity against CRPC compared to that of taxol,
cisplatin (DDP), doxorubicin (Dox), or 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), with fewer side effects in normal cells. Importantly, PL
treatment significantly decreased cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and inhibited the migration of CRPC cells
through affecting the expression and distribution of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), leading to concentrationdependent
inhibition of CRPC cell proliferation and concomitantly increased cell death. Moreover, PL treatment
triggered persistent DNA damage and provoked strong DNA damage responses in CRPC cells.
Conclusion: Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PL potently inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion
of CRPC cells and that these potent anticancer effects were potentially achieved via triggering persistent DNA
damage in CRPC cells.
