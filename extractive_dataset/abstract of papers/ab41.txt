Background: Cervical cancer is a common malignancy of the female genital tract. Treatment options for cervical
cancer patients diagnosed at FIGO (2009) stage IB2 and IIA2 remains controversial.
Methods: We perform a Bayesian network meta-analysis to directly or indirectly compare various interventions for
FIGO (2009) IB2 and IIA2 disease, in order to improve our understand of the optimal treatment strategy for these
women. Three databases were searched for articles published between 1971 and 2020. Data on included study
characteristics, outcomes, and risk of bias were abstracted by two reviewers.
Results: Seven thousand four hundred eighty-six articles were identified. Thirteen randomized controlled trials of FIGO
(2009) IB2 and IIA2 cervical cancer patients were included in the final analysis. These trials used six different interventions:
concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), radical surgery (RS), radical surgery following chemoradiotherapy (CCRT+RS),
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery (NACT+RS), adjuvant radiotherapy followed by Radical surgery
(RT + RS), radiotherapy alone (RT).SUCRA ranking of OS and Relapse identified CCRT+RS and CCRT as the best
interventions, respectively. Systematic clustering analysis identified the CCRT group as a unique cluster.
Conclusion: These data suggest that CCRT may be the best approach for improving the clinical outcome of cervical
cancer patients diagnosed at FIGO (2009) stage IB2/IIA2. Phase III randomized trials should be performed in order to
robustly assess the relative efficacy of available treatment strategies in this disease context.
