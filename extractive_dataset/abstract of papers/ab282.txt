Background: The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept injections as the primary
treatment for subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) by using optical coherence
tomography (OCT). Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was further used for some patients to
detect the changes of CNV after treatment.
Methods: In the present study, 21 treatment-naive eyes of 21 patients with subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopic CNV
received primary intravitreal aflibercept injections and were under follow-up for a minimum duration of 12 months.
Among the 21 patients, 12 underwent OCTA to evaluate the changes in central foveal thickness, selected CNV area,
and flow area.
Results: The mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) pertaining to all the patients significantly improved from the
baseline value of 0.7 to 0.3 logMAR after treatment for 12 months (P = 0.001). However, the improvements in the
median BCVA after treatment for three and 12 months were not statistically significant in the younger group (< 50
years), compared to the older group (â‰¥ 50 years). One aflibercept injection resolved the CNV in 47.6% (10/21) of the
patients. The younger group displayed greater improvement in the median central foveal thickness, compared to
the older group.
OCTA revealed interlacing or disorganized pattern at the level of the outer retinal layer in 12 subjects with myopic
CNV. After 3 months of treatment, both groups displayed a decrease in the size of the selected CNV area and flow
area. The interlacing group displayed a trend towards better anatomical improvements.
Conclusion: Intravitreal aflibercept injection provides long-term improvement in visual acuity in patients with
myopic CNV. Eyes with the interlacing pattern on OCTA displayed a greater decrease in size and flow after
aflibercept injection.
