Background: Abortion and stillbirths are the common obstetrics condition in Ethiopia and their effect on the next
pregnancy was not well identified in resource limited settings. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of stillbirth
and abortion on the next pregnancy.
Methods: A prospective cohort study design was implemented. The study was conducted in Mecha demographic
surveillance and field research center catchment areas. The data were collected from January 2015 to March 2019.
Epi-info software was used to calculate the sample size. The systematic random sampling technique was used to
select stillbirth and abortion women. Poison regression was used to identify the predictors of MCH service utilization;
descriptive statistics were used to identify the prevalence of blood borne pathogens. The Kaplan Meier survival curve
was used to estimate survival to pregnancy and pregnancy related medical disorders.
Results: 1091 stillbirth and 3,026 abortion women were followed. Hepatitis B was present in 6% of abortion and 3.2%
of stillbirth women. Hepatitis C was diagnosed in 4.7% of abortion and 0.3% of stillbirth women. HIV was detected in
3% of abortion and 0.8% of stillbirth women. MCH service utilization was determined by knowledge of contraceptives
[IRR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18–1.42], tertiary education [IRR 4.29, 95% CI 3.72–4.96], secondary education. [IRR 3.14, 95%
CI 2.73–3.61], married women [IRR 2.08, 95% CI 1.84–2.34], family size [IRR 0.67, 95% CI 1.001–1.01], the median time of
pregnancy after stillbirth and abortion were 12 months. Ante-partum hemorrhage was observed in 23.1% of pregnant
mothers with a past history of abortion cases and post-partum hemorrhage was observed in 25.6% of pregnant
mothers with a past history of abortion. PREGNANCY INDUCED DIABETES MELLITUS was observed 14.3% of pregnant
mothers with a past history of stillbirth and pregnancy-induced hypertension were observed in 9.2% of mothers with
a past history of stillbirth.
Conclusion: Obstetric hemorrhage was the common complications of abortion women while Pregnancy-induced
diabetic Mellitus and pregnancy-induced hypertension were the most common complications of stillbirth for the
next pregnancy.
