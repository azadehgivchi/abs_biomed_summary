Background: Assessment of the optical outcome and adverse events in post-epikeratopathic eyes after removal of
the epikeratoplasty lenticule (EKPL).
Methods: This was a retrospective case-series study of patients who underwent EKPL removal between 2002 and
2020. Ten eyes were included in the analysis. We compared the clinical characteristics of the patients before surgery,
6 months after surgery, before lenticular removal, and after removal, and reported optical or ocular surface
complications.
Results: We removed EKPL due to the lenticular opacity in five eyes (50%), intraocular lens (IOL) insertion (n = 4, 40%)
after cataract surgery (n = 3) or in aphakic eyes (n = 1), and lenticule-induced irregular astigmatism in one eye (10%).
After EKPL removal, the mean refractive power of the cornea (Km) revealed a tendency to increase. Out of nine cases,
six cases showed corneal steepening and three cases revealed corneal flattening. When the keratometric readings of
pre-epikeratoplasty and post-lenticular removal were compared within the same case, the average difference was 5.1
D Â± 4.0 (n = 8). Complications were observed in 3 of 10 cases (excessive corneal flatness, ectatic change, and abnormal
epithelial cell ingrowth) after removal.
Conclusions: The surgeon should expect the corneal refractive power to steepen or flatten in some cases with
abnormal astigmatism and irregularity. Epikeratophakic eyes may exhibit serious ectatic changes, and abnormal epithelial
cell ingrowth after removal of epikeratophakic lenticules.
