Background: Olmesartan, which is an angiotensin II receptor blocker, reportedly causes spruelike enteropathy, with
intestinal villous atrophy as its typical histopathological finding. Interestingly, collagenous and/or lymphocytic gastritis
and colitis occur in some patients. We report the case of a 73-year-old Japanese man with a 2-month clinical history of
severe diarrhea and weight loss. There were few reports in which spruelike enteropathy and collagenous colitis were
both observed and could be followed up.
Case presentation: We report a case of a 73-year-old man with a 2-month clinical history of severe diarrhea and
weight loss. He had taken olmesartan for hypertension treatment for 5 years. Endoscopic examination with biopsies
revealed intestinal villous atrophy and collagenous colitis. Suspecting enteropathy caused by olmesartan, which was
discontinued on admission because of hypotension, we continued to stop the drug. Within 3 weeks after olmesartan
discontinuation, his clinical symptoms improved. After 3 months, follow-up endoscopy showed improvement of villous
atrophy but not of the thickened collagen band of the colon. However, the mucosa normalized after 6 months,
histologically confirming that the preexistent pathology was finally resolved.
Conclusions: This report presents a case in which spruelike enteropathy and collagenous colitis were both observed
and could be followed up. In unexplained cases of diarrhea, medication history should be reconfirmed and this disease
should be considered a differential diagnosis.
