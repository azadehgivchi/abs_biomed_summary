Background: Deficient balance and fear of falling in elderly people can lead to disturbed daily activities, falling, and
finally reduced quality of life. Therefore, evaluation of low-risk methods that might partially improve balance in this
group of people is of utmost importance. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of Virtual Reality (VR)
exercises based on Xbox Kinect on balance and fear of falling among elderly people.
Methods: This clinical trial was performed on 60 elderly individuals living in nursing homes divided into two
groups of control and Xbox. The participants in the intervention group received VR exercises based on Xbox Kinect
in form of two 30â€“45-min sessions held on a weekly basis for 6 weeks. The individuals in the control group, on the
other hand, received routine exercises of the nursing homes. The research tools used in this study included a
demographic questionnaire, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and the Falling Efficacy
Scale (FES).
Results: The findings of the current study demonstrated that the scores of BBS and TUG test as the indices of
balance among elderly people improved significantly in the Xbox group after the intervention (p < 0.001 for both
BBS and TUG test). Moreover, the score of fear of falling diminished significantly in the intervention group
compared to the control group (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: According to the results of the present investigation, 6 weeks of VR balance exercises could enhance
balance and fear of falling among elderly people living in nursing homes.
