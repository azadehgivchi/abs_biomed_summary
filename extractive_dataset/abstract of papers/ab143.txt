Background: Beneficial effects of napping on cognition have been suggested in cross-sectional studies. This study
aimed to clarify longitudinal associations between cognitive decline and sleep characteristics, particularly daytime
napping, over a 5-year period in older adults.
Methods: Study participants were 389 community-dwelling individuals aged ≥65 years living in Ojiya City, Niigata,
Japan. Baseline and follow-up examinations were conducted in 2011–2013 and 2016–2018, respectively. Trained
nurses visited and interviewed participants to collect the following information at baseline and follow-up:
demographic characteristics, disease history, lifestyle habits including bedtime, sleeping hours, and daytime nap
duration, and cognitive function. The assessment of cognitive function was performed using the revised
Hasegawa’s dementia scale (HDS-R), with cognitive decline defined as a change in the HDS-R of ≤−3 over 5 years.
Odds ratios (ORs) for cognitive decline were calculated using multiple logistic regression analysis.
Results: Mean age of participants was 74.6 years (SD 6.4), and the cumulative incidence of cognitive decline was 106/
389 (27.3%). The adjusted OR for 1–29 min daytime napping was significantly lower compared to that for no napping
(OR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.23–0.96). Earlier bedtime was associated with cognitive decline (adjusted P for trend = 0.0480).
Conclusion: Short daytime napping (< 30 min) reduces the risk of cognitive decline over 5 years for communitydwelling
older people. A future study will be necessary to confirm the effect of short napping on the reduction of risk
for clinically diagnosed dementia.
