Background: Nurse and Midwifery Unit Managers (NMUMs) play pivotal roles in quality patient care, nurse and
midwife satisfaction and retention. NMUMs are expected to be both leaders and managers simultaneously, which
may create role tension. This study aimed to explore the understanding and experience of NMUMs regarding their
role; to explore what barriers and facilitators NMUMs identified to achieving the goals of their clinical area; and to
explore NMUMsâ€™ career plans.
Methods: Set in Victoria, Australia, this study was guided by naturalistic inquiry using a qualitative descriptive
approach. Thematic analysis was used to inductively develop core themes, which facilitated the motivations,
experience and meanings underlying the data to be elaborated.
Results: In all, 39 interviews were conducted with NMUMs across four hospitals. Two overarching themes were
identified from the data; system challenges and influences on people and each theme had three sub-themes. In
relation to system challenges, participants spoke about the structural challenges that they encountered such as
financial stressors and physical infrastructure that made their work difficult. Participants felt they were unprepared
for the NMUM role and had limited support in the preparation for the role. Participants also related their frustration
of not being included in important decision-making processes within the hospital. Regarding their career plans,
most did not envisage a career beyond that of a NMUM.
Conclusions: This study of contemporary NMUMs uncovered a continued lack of investment in the orientation,
professional development and support of this critical leadership and management role. There is an urgent need for
targeted interventions to support and develop capabilities of NMUMs to meet the current and evolving demands
of their role.
