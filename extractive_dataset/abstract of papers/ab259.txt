Background: Extreme delta brush (EDB) is considered a potential marker for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor
(anti-NMDAR) encephalitis. The brain regions involved in EDB are unclear.
Case presentation: A 16-year-old woman with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who was experiencing psychosis was
admitted. Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) were used to analyze EDB in the
patient. EDB on EEG could be disturbed by opening and closing the eyes, by occipital alpha rhythms and by sleepwake
cycles. The MEG results showed beta activity originating from bilateral superior parietal lobes. However, the
delta wave originated from bilateral superior temporal gyri, the right middle temporal gyrus, the right inferior
frontal gyrus, and the left inferior parietal lobe.
Conclusions: Delta wave and beta activity might originate from different brain regions. Beta activity might be
transmitted forward to the frontotemporal lobe and superimposed with delta activity to form EDB on EEG.
