Background: Development of gastrointestinal (GI) complications is adversely associated with prognosis in the
critically ill. However, little is known about their impact on the outcome of non-critically ill patients. In this study, we
aimed to investigate the incidence of GI complications and their influence on prognosis of hospitalized pneumonia
patients.
Methods: Adult patients admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia from 2012 to 2014 were included. Medical records
were reviewed to obtain patients’ demographics, physical signs, comorbidities, laboratory results, clinical events,
and the Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure and age ≥ 65 (CURB-65) score was calculated to assess the
severity of pneumonia. GI complications, including bowel distension, diarrhea, GI bleeding and ileus, were evaluated
during the first 3 days of hospitalization and their association with patient outcomes, such as hospital mortality and
length of stay, was analyzed.
Results: A total of 1001 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 73.7 years and 598 (59%) male. Among them,
114 (11%) patients experienced at least one GI complication and diarrhea (5.2%) was the most common. The hospital
mortality was 14% and was independently associated with an increase in the CURB-65 score (odds ratio [OR] 1.952
per point increase; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.516–2.514), comorbid malignancy (OR 1.943; 95% CI 1.209–3.123),
development of septic shock (OR 25.896; 95% CI 8.970–74.765), and the presence of any GI complication (OR 1.753;
95% CI 1.003–3.065).
Conclusions: Compared to a critical care setting, GI complications are not commonly observed in a non-critical care
setting; however, they still have a negative impact on prognosis of pneumonia patients, including higher mortality
and prolonged length of hospital stay.
