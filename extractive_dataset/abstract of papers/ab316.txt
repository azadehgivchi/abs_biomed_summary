Background: There is a lack of a comprehensive evaluation for pediatric clinical practice guidelines (CPGs)
published in recent years. Here, we assessed the quality of pediatric CPGs, considering factors that might affect
their quality. The aim of the study is to promote a more coherent development and application of CPGs.
Methods: Pediatric CPGs published in PubMed, MedLive, Guidelines International Network, National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence, and World Health Organization between 2017 and 2019 were searched and collected.
Paired researchers conducted screening, data extraction, and quality assessment using the Appraisal of Guidelines
for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II). Linear regression analysis determined the factors affecting CPGs’ quality.
Results: The study included a total of 216 CPGs, which achieved a mean score of 4.26 out of 7 points (60.86%) in
the AGREE II assessment. Only 6.48% of the CPGs reached the “recommend” level. The remaining 69.91% should
have been modified before recommendation, while the other 23.61% did not reach the recommended level at all.
The overall quality of recent pediatric CPGs was higher than previously, and the proportion of CPGs with lowquality
decreased over time. However, there were still too few CPGs that reached a high-quality level. The
“applicability” and “rigor of development” domains had generally low scores. CPGs formulated by developing
countries or regions, those that are not under an organizations or groups responsibility, and those that used nonevidence-
based methods were found to be associated with poorer quality in different domains as independent or
combinational factors.
Conclusions: The quality of pediatric CPGs still needs to be improved. Specifically, a quality control before applying
new CPGs should be essential to ensure their quality and applicability.
