Background: The tripartite motif (TRIM) family proteins exhibit oncogenic roles in various cancers. The roles of
TRIM27, a member of the TRIM super family, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remained unexplored. In the current
study, we aimed to investigate the clinical impact and roles of TRIM27 in the development of RCC.
Methods: The mRNA levels of TRIM27 and Kaplan–Meier survival of RCC were analyzed from The Cancer Genome
Atlas database. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to measure the mRNA and protein levels of TRIM27
both in vivo and in vitro. siRNA and TRIM27 were exogenously overexpressed in RCC cell lines to manipulate
TRIM27 expression.
Results: We discovered that TRIM27 was elevated in RCC patients, and the expression of TRIM27 was closely
correlated with poor prognosis. The loss of function and gain of function results illustrated that TRIM27 promotes
cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in RCC cell lines. Furthermore, TRIM27 expression was positively associated
with NF-κB expression in patients with RCC. Blocking the activity of NF-κB attenuated the TRIM27-mediated
enhancement of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. TRIM27 directly interacted with Iκbα, an inhibitor of NF-
κB, to promote its ubiquitination, and the inhibitory effects of TRIM27 on Iκbα led to NF-κB activation.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that TRIM27 exhibits an oncogenic role in RCC by regulating NF-κB signaling.
TRIM27 serves as a specific prognostic indicator for RCC, and strategies targeting the suppression of TRIM27
function may shed light on future therapeutic approaches.
