Background: Thriving has emerged as a contemporary and health-promoting concept for older people living in
nursing homes; however, there has been limited research to explore how nursing home staff identify thriving in
their everyday practice. The aim of this study was to explore how staff recognize expressions of thriving among
persons living in nursing homes.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 nurses working at a nursing home in Victoria,
Australia. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
Results: The analysis resulted in six sub-categories and three main categories. Expressions of thriving were
recognized in relation to how staff understood thriving, observed thriving and sensed thriving. Staff described
comparing and contrasting clinical assessment indicators with their own personal and professional understandings
of thriving, as well as their overall sense of the individual person within the wider situational and environmental
context.
Conclusions: Our results illuminate how staff recognize everyday expressions of thriving for people living in
nursing homes and emphasizes the importance of utilizing person-centred care principles in clinical assessments.
These findings have practical implications with regards to how thriving is identified and assessed in long-term care,
and could be used to inform and guide staff education, person-centred care strategies, and organizational policies
to better support and promote thriving in nursing homes.
