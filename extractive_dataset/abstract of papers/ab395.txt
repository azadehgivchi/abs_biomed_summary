Background: Regular participation in exercise is important for people with cystic fbrosis (CF). Therefore, we implemented a personalized, web-based exercise intervention over the course of one year for people with CF. The aims
were to investigate the feasibility of the intervention and to evaluate changes in exercise participation, lung function,
and exercise capacity.
Methods: In total, 11/17 participants [aged 12–52 years; FEV1%pred. 72.3 (SD: 17.3)] were included in the fnal data
analysis. Every week, the participants received an individual training recommendation at the start and uploaded their
training report on our website at the end of each week. The number of training minutes and sessions performed were
analyzed over 13 four-week training sections. The participation in exercise (physical activity questionnaire), lung function and exercise capacity were assessed at baseline (T0), after 12 weeks (T1) and after 52 weeks (T2).
Results: A training duration of 178 min (SD: 75.5) and 3.3 (SD: 0.89) training sessions could be achieved weekly. In
the frst four-week training section, the participants performed 137.31 (SD: 95.7) minutes of training, with an increase
of 42% in the third training section (195.01, SD: 134.99). Minutes of training reported on the questionnaire increased
by 39.7% from T0 (179.38 min, SD: 120.9) to T1 (250.63 min, SD: 124.1) but decreased at T2 (166.88, SD: 155.4). There
were slight decreases in lung function (FEV1 − 3.9%pred.; FVC − 1.9%pred.) and slight increases in exercise capacity
(VO2peak+1.5 ml/min/kg; six-minute-walk-test-distance+26 m). Noticeably, fve participants experienced deteriorations in their FEV1 of more than 5% but simultaneously experienced improvements in the parameters of exercise
capacity of more than 5% throughout the year.
Conclusions: The web-based concept was feasible for the participants over the course of a year and supported
exercise participation. The improvement in exercise capacity due to increased exercise participation over a prolonged
period of time, despite a decrease in lung function, should be further investigated. Finally, if integrated into usual care,
this approach could facilitate the prescription of regular personalized exercise and promote exercise participation in
the daily lives of people with CF.
