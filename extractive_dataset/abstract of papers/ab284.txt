Purpose: To describe myopic nontractional foveal detachment associated with pachychoroid diseases.
Methods: This retrospective study included 15 myopic eyes which had nontractional serous foveal detachment. The
eyes were divided into myopic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) group (n = 8) and a myopic pachychoroid
neovascularization (PNV) group (n = 7) according to the presence of type 1 choroidal neovascularization on multimodal
imaging. The findings of multimodal imaging and treatment response were described.
Results: In myopic CSC group, pachychoroid features such as pachyvessels, choroidal vascular hyperpermeability and
punctate hyperfluorescent spots were noted in 8 eyes (100%), 8 eyes (100%), 5 eyes (62.5%) respectively. The above
features were noted in 7 eyes (100%), 5 eyes (83.3%), 5 eyes (83.3%), respectively, in the myopic PNV group. Five of 8
eyes in myopic CSC and all 7 eyes received treatment including anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection and/
or photodynamic therapy. However, only five eyes had a complete response.
Conclusions: The pachychoroid phenotype may coexist with high myopia and lead to myopic nontractional serous
foveal detachment. Our series suggest that the response to treatment for these conditions would be limited.
