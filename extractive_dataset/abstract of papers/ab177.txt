Background: Altruism refers to acting in ‘the best interest of patients, not self-interest’. With an observed
discordance between the concept and practice of altruism, and increasing attention to ‘pathologic altruism’, the
role of altruism is blurred in present day medical care. In this background, the required balance of altruistic attitude
which needs to be fostered in medical students needs clarity. This problem may be best addressed by the
practicing clinicians. The objectives of this study were to explore clinicians’ understanding of altruism in the clinical
context and to identify the key concepts of altruism which they felt, must be included in clinical practice.
Methods: It was an exploratory qualitative study to identify clinicians’ understanding of altruism and the key
practice points for altruism. Online semi-structured interviews were conducted from 18 clinicians through Zoom
and transcribed using Otter. Open coding of interview transcripts was done using Atlas ti 8 and grouped by
commonalities under sub themes and themes.
Results: The main concepts regarding the clinicians’ understanding of altruism were prioritizing patients’ interest
above oneself, favouring patients beyond routine duty and organized team work for practicing altruism. The
essential practice areas identified for altruism were finding a balance between altruistic tendency and self/family life,
identifying one’s individual capacity for altruism, establishing teamwork for developing a workplace altruistic
attitude, and facilitating patients beyond routine duty.
Conclusions: Altruism is an important professionalism attribute for clinicians, however prioritizing patients interest
requires a balanced approach so that it is effective and sustainable. Workplace altruistic cultures may be better
promoted through organized team-based approach rather than individual efforts.
