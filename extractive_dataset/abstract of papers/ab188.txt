Background: Systematic ethics support in community health services in Norway is in the initial phase. There are
few evaluation studies about the significance of ethics reflection on care. The aim of this study was to evaluate
systematic ethics reflection in groups in community health (including nursing homes and residency), - from the
perspectives of employees participating in the groups, the group facilitators and the service managers. The reflection
groups were implemented as part of a research and development project.
Methods: A mixed-methods design with qualitative focus group interviews, observations and written reports were
used to evaluate. The study was conducted at two nursing homes, two home care districts and a residence for people
with learning disabilities. Participants were employees, facilitators and service managers. The study was guided by
ethical standard principles and was approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services.
Results: We found support for ethics reflection as a valuable measure to strengthen clinical practice. New and improved
solutions, more cooperation between employees, and improved collaboration with patients and their families are some
of the results. No negative experiences were found. Instead, the ethics reflection based on experiences and challenges in
the workplace, was described as a win-win situation. The evaluation also revealed what is needed to succeed and useful
tips for further development of ethics support in community health services.
Conclusions: Ethics reflection groups focusing on ethical challenges from the participantsâ€™ daily work were found to be
significant for improved practice, collegial support and cooperation, personal and professional development among staff,
facilitators and managers. Resources needed to succeed were managerial support, and anchoring ethics sessions in the
routine of daily work.
