Background: OPTION5 is a scale used to evaluate shared decision making (SDM) in health care from an observer’s
perspective; however, to date, there is no simplified Chinese version of this scale.
Objectives: This study aims to produce a simplified Chinese version of the OPTION5 scale and to test its
psychometric properties.
Methods: One rater observed and audio-recorded consultations between general practitioners (GPs) and
chronically ill patients in a Beijing community health service center (CHSC) from May to June 2019. Meanwhile,
demographic data of the patients and GPs were collected via information forms. Two raters assessed inter- and
intra-rater reliability by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and weighted Cohen’s Kappa values.
Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s α value. Concurrent was calculated by Spearman’s rank
correlation coefficient.
Results: A total of 209 consultations were recorded and evaluated. As concerns inter-rater reliability, the ICC of the
OPTION5 was 0.859 on the total score level, with Cohen’s weighted k ranging from 0.376 (item 5) to 0.649 (item 2) on the
single item level. With regard to intra-rater reliability, the ICC was 0.945 on the total score level, with Cohen’s weighted k
ranging from 0.469 (item 5) to 0.883 (item1) on the single item level. Cronbach’s α value of all 5 items amounted to 0.746.
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between OPTION5 and OPTION12 for Chinese versions was 0.660.
Conclusions: The simplified Chinese version of the OPTION5 scale, developed using stringent translation procedures,
demonstrated satisfactory psychometric characteristics. Specifically, inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were excellent,
while criterion validity was moderate. The simplified Chinese version of the OPTION5 scale can be implemented in
clinical settings to evaluate SDM of treatment during consultations between GPs and chronically ill patient
