Background: Adolescence is a particularly vulnerable stages of life in which malnutrition inhibits academic performance
through poor growth and development, mental retardation, poor overall cognitive function and poor health status.
However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding the association between nutritional status and academic performance
among adolescent students. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association of nutritional status and academic
performance among adolescent secondary school students in Wolaita Sodo town, Southern Ethiopia.
Methods: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 670 systematically selected adolescents in secondary
schools of Wolaita Sodo town from April to June 2019. The academic performance of the adolescents was measured using
the mean mark score of two consecutive semesters’ results of all subjects. Data were analyzed using Stata software Version
15. Descriptive statistics, binary and multiple linear regression analysis were done. Statistical association of dependent and
independent variables was declared at p-value<0.05.
Results: The mean academic performance of students was 69.21 ± 0.42 (95% CI: 68.34–70.02%). A mean mark
score of students increased by 1.89 (β = 1.89; 95%CI: 1.14, 2.64) for a unit increase in BMI for age z-score. Being
female decreased a mean mark score by 2.63 (β = − 2.63; 95%CI: − 4.28, − 0.98) and being from a separated
parents decreased by 4.73 (β = − 4. 73; 95%CI: − 6.73, − 2.74). A mean mark score of students from the first wealth
class decreased by 9.92 (− 9.92; 95%CI: − 12.79, − 7.04) as compared to students from the highest wealth class.
Attending private schools increased the mean mark score of students by 4.18 (β = 4.18; 95% CI: 2.46, 5.90).
Conclusions: Interventions targeted at adolescents’ nutritional status should be designed and implemented. The town
education office and concerned bodies should launch a school feeding program for public schools. Development and
income generation activities should target households in the first wealth status. Schools are recommended to design
additional teaching and learning schemes such as tutorial classes for girl students.
