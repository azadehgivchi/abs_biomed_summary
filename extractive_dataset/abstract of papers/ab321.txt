Background: This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of alamandine, a new member of the angiotensin
family, against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.
Methods: Rats were intraperitoneally injected with DOX (3.750 mg/kg/week) to reach a total cumulative dose of
15 mg/kg by day 35. Alamandine (50 μg/kg/day) was administered to the rats via mini-osmotic pumps for 42 days.
At the end of the experiment, rats were placed in the metabolic cages for 24 h so that their water intake and urine
output could be measured. After scarification, the rats’ serum and kidney tissues were collected, and biochemical,
histopathological, and immunohistochemical studies were carried out.
Results: DOX administration yielded increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6,
pro-fibrotic proteins transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear kappa B
(NF-κB), kidney malondialdehyde (MDA), creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and water intake. On the
other hand, the DOX-treated group exhibited decreased renal superoxide dismutase (SOD), renal glutathione
peroxidase (GPx) activity, and urinary output. Alamandine co-therapy decreased these effects, as confirmed by
histopathology and immunohistochemical analysis.
Conclusions: The results suggest that alamandine can prevent nephrotoxicity induced by DOX in rats.
