Background: The current study examined the predictors of the onset of alcohol use as well as predictors of remission
and relapse, both from heavy drinking and from alcohol dependence. Similarities and differences in both clinical
and psychosocial predictors across the transitions were examined.
Methods: A sample of men from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry (N = 1769) completed an assessment of lifetime
drinking history, which allowed age markers for starting and stopping different drinking patterns. The men also completed
various assessments regarding personality, alcohol motives, and psychiatric diagnoses. Survival analyses were
used to examine the predictors of the three transitions of onset, remission, and relapse for the phenotypes of heavy
drinking and of alcohol dependence, censoring the individuals who had not yet experienced an event.
Results: As expected, predictors of onset for drinking, heavy drinking, and alcohol dependence were largely consistent
and included externalizing symptomology, nicotine dependence, and cotwin history of drinking as risk factors.
Predictors of remission from heavy drinking, somewhat similarly to remission from alcohol dependence, included the
risk factor of externalizing disorders but also, as predicted, included more risk and protective factors in the psychosocial
realm that were not predictors of onset. Contrary to our prediction, relapse to heavy drinking and alcohol dependence
were predicted largely by unique psychosocial risk and protective factors including social and coping motives.
Conclusion: Current findings extend the findings of past research to remission and relapse in the later decades of life
and have implications for treatment of alcohol use problems.
