Abstract
Background: One-stop occlusion, which is defined as the combination of atrial septal defect [ASD] or patent
foramen ovale [PFO] occlusion and left atrial appendage [LAA] closure, in patients with ASD/PFO and atrial
fibrillation (AF) has not yet been investigated systematically. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
one-stop occlusion in the treatment of adult patients with ASD/PFO and AF.
Methods: Inpatients with AF and ASD/PFO were recruited between August 2014 and April 2019. Preoperatively,
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were conducted to identify the
ASD/PFO size and margin, presence of thrombus in the LAA, and LAA orifice width and depth at 0°, 45°, 90°, and
135°. After confirmation of the indications of LAA closure (LAAC) and ASD/PFO occlusion, the procedures were
performed simultaneously under general anesthesia. Oral anticoagulants were administered for 45–60 days,
followed with regular evaluation of TTE and TEE.
Results: Forty-nine patients (age, 65.6 ± 9.6 years) were recruited in this study, including 24 patients with ASD and
25 patients with PFO. They were treated with LAAC and ASD/PFO occlusion successfully. The mean ASD size and
mean diameter of the ASD occluders were 14.2 ± 7.7 and 25.4 ± 8.5 mm, respectively. The mean PFO size was 3.5 ±
0.4 mm. The mean maximal LAA orifice width and depth were 20.5 ± 3.4 and 28.3 ± 3.6 mm, respectively. All
patients were implanted with a Watchman device (diameter, 27.1 ± 2.9 mm). Postoperatively, all patients took
anticoagulants orally for 45–60 days, and their mean postoperative follow-up duration was 29.0 ± 12.1 months.
Postoperative TEE showed that all had normal positioning of the LAA and ASD/PFO occluders. At 45–60 days after
operation, TEE showed that the LAA and ASD/PFO occluder were in the normal position; however, two patients
who took warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants, respectively, have developed occluder thrombosis. After adjusted
anticoagulant therapy, TEE showed that the thrombus disappeared at 6 months after operation.
