Background: Advocacy is a core component of medical professionalism. It is unclear how educators can best
prepare trainees for this professional obligation. We sought to assess medical students’ attitudes toward advocacy,
including activities and issues of interest, and to determine congruence with professional obligations.
Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey probed U.S. medical students’ attitudes around 7 medical issues
(e.g. nutrition/obesity, addiction) and 11 determinants of health (e.g. housing, transportation). Descriptive statistics,
Kruskal-Wallis tests, and regression analysis investigated associations with demographic characteristics.
Results: Of 240 students completing the survey, 53% were female; most were white (62%) or Asian (28%). Most
agreed it is very important that physicians encourage medical organizations to advocate for public health (76%)
and provide health-related expertise to the community (57%). More participants rated advocacy for medical issues
as very important, compared to issues with indirect connections to health (p < 0.001). Generally, liberals and nonwhites
were likelier than others to value advocacy.
Conclusions: Medical students reported strong interest in advocacy, particularly around health issues, consistent
with professional standards. Many attitudes were associated with political affiliation and race. To optimize future
physician advocacy, educators should provide opportunities for learning and engagement in issues of interest.
