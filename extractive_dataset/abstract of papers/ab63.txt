Background: A few studies have reported that administration of lidocaine and dexmedetomidine relieves the
incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). We explored whether combined infusion of lidocaine plus
dexmedetomidine had lower occurrence of PONV undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy with general anesthesia.
Methods: A total of 248 women undergoing elective laparoscopic hysterectomy were allocated into the following
four groups: the control group (group C, n = 62) received an equal volume of saline, the lidocaine group (group L,
n = 62) received intravenous lidocaine (bolus infusion of 1.5 mg/kg over 10 min, 1.5 mg/kg/h continuous infusion),
the dexmedetomidine group (group D, n = 62) received dexmedetomidine administration (bolus infusion of 0.5 μg/
kg over 10 min, 0.4 μg/kg/h continuous infusion), and the lidocaine plus dexmedetomidine group (group LD, n = 62)
received combination of lidocaine (bolus infusion of 1.5 mg/kg over 10 min, 1.5 mg/kg/h continuous infusion) and
dexmedetomidine administration (bolus infusion of 0.5 μg/kg over 10 min, 0.4 μg/kg/h continuous infusion). The
primary outcome was the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and PONV during the first 48 h after surgery. The secondary
outcomes included the incidence of total 24 h PONV after surgery, intraoperative remifentanil requirement, postoperative
pain visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and fentanyl consumption, the incidence of bradycardia, agitation,
shivering, and mouth dry during post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay period.
Results: The occurrence of nausea and PONV in group LD (5.0 and 8.3%) at 0–2 h after operation was lower than
group C (21.7 and 28.3%) (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference with respect to occurrence of
nausea and PONV in groups L (13.3 and 20.0%) and D (8.3 and 13.3%) at 0–2 h after operation compared to group C
(21.7 and 28.3%). The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and PONV at 2–24 and 24–48 h after surgery in all four groups
was not statistically significant. The incidence of total 24 h PONV in group LD (33.3%) was significantly decreased
compared to group C (60.0%) (P < 0.05). The cumulative consumption of fentanyl at 6 and 12 h after surgery was
significantly reduced in group LD compared to other three groups (P < 0.05). The pain VAS scores were significantly
decreased at 2, 6, and 12 h after operation in group LD compared to other three groups (P < 0.05). Remifentanil dose
in the intraoperative period was significantly lower in groups LD and D compared with groups C and L (P < 0.05). The
number of mouth dry, bradycardia, and over sedation during the PACU stay period was markedly increased in group
LD (28.3, 30.0, and 35.0%, respectively) compared with groups C (1.7, 1.7, and 3.3%, respectively) and L (3.3, 5.0, and
6.7%, respectively) (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: Lidocaine combined with dexmedetomidine infusion markedly decreased the occurrence of nausea
and PONV at 0–2 h as well as the total 24 h PONV. However, it significantly increased the incidence of mouth dry,
bradycardia, and over sedation during the PACU stay period after laparoscopic hysterectomy with general anesthesia.
