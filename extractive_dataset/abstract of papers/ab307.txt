Background: Spiritual care is frequently cited as a key component of hospice care in Taiwanese healthcare and
beyond. The aim of this research is to gauge physicians and nurses’ self-reported perspectives and clinical practices
on the roles of their professions in addressing spiritual care in an inpatient palliative care unit in a tertiary hospital
with Buddhist origins.
Methods: We performed semi-structured interviews with physicians and nurses working in hospice care over a year
on their self-reported experiences in inpatient spiritual care. We utilized a directed approach to qualitative content
analysis to identify themes emerging from interviews.
Results: Most participants identified as neither spiritual nor religious. Themes in defining spiritual care, spiritual
distress, and spiritual care challenges included understanding patient values and beliefs, fear of the afterlife and
repercussions of poor family relationships, difficulties in communication, the patient’s medical state, and a perceived
lack of preparedness and time to deliver spiritual care.
Conclusions: Our study suggests that Taiwanese physicians and nurses overall find spiritual care difficult to define
in practice and base perceptions and practices of spiritual care largely on patient’s emotional and physical needs.
Spiritual care is also burdened logistically by difficulties in navigating family and cultural dynamics, such as speaking
openly about death. More research on spiritual care in Taiwan is needed to define the appropriate training, practice,
and associated challenges in provision of spiritual care.
