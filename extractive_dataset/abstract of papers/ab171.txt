Introduction: Migration of medical professionals has been rapidly increasing in the past decades and it strongly
affects origin and destination countries.
Objectives: We aimed to explore the extent and the reasons of migration among psychiatric trainees and early
career psychiatrists in Iran.
Methods: Our semi-structured 61-items questionnaire inquired participants’ demographics, experiences of shortterm
mobility (from 3 months to 1 year), long-term migration (more than 1 year) and attitudes towards migration
(current and future plans).
Results: A total of 184 responses were received. Most (73.4 %) participants were female, and within the age range
of 25–65 (Mean: 34.9). Only 15.2 % had a short-term mobility experience, mostly due to academic reasons (35.7 %).
Most (75 %) stated that this short-term mobility experience influenced them in favor of migration. The majority
(83.7 %) had ‘ever’ considered leaving Iran, and more than half (57.3 %) stated they ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’ to
leaving the country ‘now’ (at the time of the study). The main reason to migrate from Iran was first political,
followed by work, financial, social, religious, academic, and cultural reasons, and the least ranked were personal
reasons. In relation to their 5-year plans, 67.3 % saw themselves in the country they currently live in, Iran. The main
features reported for an attractive job were ‘pleasant work environment’ (97.3 %), ‘good welfare and social security’
(96.7 %) and ‘high salary ‘(96.2 %).
Conclusions: This study calls for more support of psychiatric trainees and early career psychiatrists in Iran.
Improvements in the political context, work conditions and finances might lower the rate of migratory intention
and brain drain.
