Background: Transitioning from an old medical coding system to a new one can be challenging, especially when
the two coding systems are significantly different. The US experienced such a transition in 2015.
Objective: This research aims to introduce entropic measures to help users prepare for the migration to a new
medical coding system by identifying and focusing preparation initiatives on clinical concepts with more likelihood of
adoption challenges.
Methods: Two entropic measures of coding complexity are introduced. The first measure is a function of the variation
in the alphabets of new codes. The second measure is based on the possible number of valid representations of
an old code.
Results: A demonstration of how to implement the proposed techniques is carried out using the 2015 mappings
between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM/PCS. The significance of the resulting entropic measures is discussed in the context
of clinical concepts that were likely to pose challenges regarding documentation, coding errors, and longitudinal
data comparisons.
Conclusion: The proposed entropic techniques are suitable to assess the complexity between any two medical coding
systems where mappings or crosswalks exist. The more the entropy, the more likelihood of adoption challenges.
Users can utilize the suggested techniques as a guide to prioritize training efforts to improve documentation and
increase the chances of accurate coding, code validity, and longitudinal data comparisons.
