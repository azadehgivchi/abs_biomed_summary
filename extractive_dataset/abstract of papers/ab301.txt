Background: There is a need for more insight into how to address challenges of information-provision for women
with advanced breast cancer. We aimed to explore oncologists’ and patients’ views on (i) the challenges of information-
provision, and (ii) possible strategies to address these challenges, meanwhile (iii) exploring the possible facilitating
role of positive expectations and empathy.
Methods: Semi-structured interviews were held with oncologists (n = 10) and women with advanced breast cancer
(n = 14). Principles of Thematic Analysis were followed, with two researchers analyzing transcribed data, supported by
Atlas.ti software.
Results: Taken together the data from oncologists and patients, we found that when communicating with patients
with advanced cancer, oncologists face challenges, including handling patients’ unrealistic disease (status) beliefs, and
choosing approaches for discussing available treatment options and their side effects. Possible strategies to address
these challenges include balancing information with acceptance of denial, and using medical expertise to guide
treatment discussions. A sensitive issue is whether to discuss the option of no anti-cancer treatment. Meanwhile,
approaches and preferences for discussions of side effects vary. Positive expectations and empathy can facilitate
information-provision by creating space and helping patients to open up more.
Conclusions: Integrating oncologists’ and patients’ views, oncologists can provide realistic information while also,
temporarily, accepting denial, and can use their medical expertise to address challenges around unrealistic beliefs
and discussion of treatment options. Finding ways to tailor discussions of no anti-cancer treatment and side-effect
information are needed. Positive expectations and empathy might facilitate – tailored – information-provision, leading
ultimately to patient-centered care lying at the heart of medicine.
