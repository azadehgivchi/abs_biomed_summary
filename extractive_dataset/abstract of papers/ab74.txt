Abstract
Background: Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a new-emerging cancer treatment in China but its treatment costs are
high and not yet covered by Chinese public medical insurance. The advanced form of PBT, intensity-modulated
proton radiation therapy (IMPT), has been confirmed to reduce normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) as
compared to conventional intensity-modulated photon-radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with oropharyngeal
cancer (OPC). Herein, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness and applicability of IMPT versus IMRT for OPC patients in
China, aiming at guiding the proper use of PBT.
Methods: A 7-state Markov model was designed for analysis. Base-case evaluation was performed on a 56-year-old
(median age of OPC in China) patient under the assumption that IMPT could provide a 25% NTCP-reduction in
long-term symptomatic dysphagia and xerostomia. Model robustness was examined using probabilistic sensitivity
analysis, cohort analysis, and tornado diagram. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify the cost-
effective scenarios. IMPT was considered as cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was
below the societal willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold.
Results: Compared with IMRT, IMPT provided an extra 0.205 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) at an additional cost of
34,926.6 US dollars ($), and had an ICER of $170,082.4/ QALY for the base case. At the current WTP of China ($33,558 /
QALY) and a current IMPT treatment costs of $50,000, IMPT should provide a minimum NTCP-reduction of 47.5, 50.8,
55.6, 63.3 and 77.2% to be considered cost-effective for patient age levels of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50-year-old, respectively.
For patients at the median age level, reducing the current IMPT costs ($50,000) to a $30,000 level would make the
minimum NTCP-reduction threshold for “cost-effective” decrease from 91.4 to 44.6%, at the current WTP of China (from
69.0 to 33.5%, at a WTP of $50,000 / QALY; and from 39.7 to 19.1%, at a WTP of $100,000 / QALY).

Conclusions: Cost-effective scenarios of PBT exist in Chinese OPC patients at the current WTP of China. Considering a
potential upcoming increase in PBT use in China, such cost-effective scenarios may further expand if a decrease of
proton treatment costs occurs or an increase of WTP level.
