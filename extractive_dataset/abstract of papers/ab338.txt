Background: A high rate of cesarean delivery has become a cause of global concern. Although the rate of
cesarean delivery has declined over recent years, it remains at a high level largely because of cesarean delivery on
maternal request (CDMR). Unnecessary cesarean delivery has limited significance in benefiting maternal and infant
physical health; in some ways, it might pose potential risks instead. With the implementation of the “Two-child
Policy” in China, an increasing number of women plan to have a second child. Accordingly, how to handle the
CDMR rate in China remains an important issue.
Methods: Data were collected from a longitudinal follow-up study conducted in Chongqing, China, from 2018 to
2019. A structured questionnaire was administered to subjects for data collection. Basic information, including
demographic characteristics, living habits, medical history, and follow-up data of pregnant women, as well as their
families and society, was collected. Additionally, delivery outcomes were recorded. Logistic regression was
performed to analyze the factors influencing CDMR.
Results: The rate of cesarean delivery in Chongqing, China was 36.01 %, and the CDMR rate was 8.42 %. Maternal
request (23.38 %), fetal distress (22.73 %), and pregnancy complications (9.96 %) were the top three indications for
cesarean delivery. Logistic regression analysis showed that older age (OR = 4.292, 95 % CI: 1.984–9.283) and being a
primiparous woman (OR = 6.792, 95 % CI: 3.230-14.281) were risk factors for CDMR. In addition, CDMR was also
associated with factors such as the tendency to choose cesarean delivery during late pregnancy (OR = 5.525, 95 %
CI: 2.116–14.431), frequent contact with mothers who had undergone vaginal deliveries (OR = 0.547, 95 % CI: 0.311–
0.961), and the recommendation of cesarean delivery by doctors (OR = 4.071, 95 % CI: 1.007–16.455).
Conclusions: “Maternal request” has become the primary indication for cesarean delivery. The occurrence of CDMR
is related to both the personal factors of women during pregnancy and others. Medical institutions and
obstetricians should continue popularizing delivery knowledge among pregnant women, enhancing their own
professional knowledge about delivery, adhering to the standard indications for cesarean delivery, and providing
pregnant women with adequate opportunities for attempting vaginal delivery.
