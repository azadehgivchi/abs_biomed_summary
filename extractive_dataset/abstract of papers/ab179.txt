Background: A good understanding of the bi-directional relationship between diabetes and periodontitis is
essential to ensure the successful management of both diseases. This study aimed to develop and evaluate an
integrated diabetes-periodontitis nutrition and health education module.
Methods: The module was developed as an iterative and review process by five experts in nutrition and dietetics,
periodontics, and dental public health. It consisted of three phases: (i) needs assessment on module contents and
characteristics, (ii) module development and (iii) module evaluation by experts. Twelve healthcare professionals
aged between 30 and 53 years (average 13.5 years of working experience) validated the module contents and its
comprehensibility using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for printable materials (PEMAT-P) and
audio-visual materials (PEMAT-A/V). Scores of 0 (disagree) or 1 (agree) were given for sets of understandability and
actionability statements and presented as a total percentage.
Results: Seventeen infographic-flip charts and 13 short-videos were developed in the Malay language and grouped
into four topics: (i) Introduction to Diabetes and Periodontitis, (ii) Diabetes and Periodontitis Care, (iii) Lifestyle
Modification, and (iv) Myths and Facts. Flip charts were rated between 76-100% for understandability and 80â€“100%
for actionability, while videos rated between 90-100% for understandability and 100% for actionability, respectively.
Conclusion: Overall, the newly developed module ranked high median scores for understandability and
actionability. This finding reflects positive acceptance of the integrated module among the various healthcare
professionals involved in managing patients with diabetes and periodontitis.
