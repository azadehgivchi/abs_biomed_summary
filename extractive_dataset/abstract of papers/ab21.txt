Background: Orbital solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare neoplasms. Recurrent, hypervascular, malignant variations
of orbital SFTs have recently been noted and can present a surgical challenge.
Case presentation: We describe a case of a 53-year-old Chinese woman with a history of a resected orbital SFT. She
presented with proptosis, limited eyeball movement, and visual loss in the right eye, suggestive of a recurrent SFT.
Ocular examination with multimodal imaging revealed a large, nonpulsatile, noncompressible, hypervascular mass
behind the eyeball. The patient underwent preoperative transarterial embolization of the main blood supply to the
tumor in order to control intraoperative blood loss, followed by ocular enucleation to optimize exposure and enable
complete resection of the tumor. Embolization of the right ophthalmic artery and the distal branch of the right internal
maxillary artery caused an immediate, substantial reduction of vascular flow, which allowed us to enucleate the
eyeball and resect the tumor with minimal blood loss and no complications.
Conclusions: Our case is so far the first Chinese case of successful preoperative embolization of the main blood
supply to a large, recurrent, hypervascular orbital SFT. This case also described a different surgical approach to achieve
total removal of an orbital SFT without osteotomy.
