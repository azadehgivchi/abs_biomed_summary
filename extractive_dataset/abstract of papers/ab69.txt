Abstract 
Background: To investigate the effects of different plasma target concentrations of remifentanil on the minimum 
alveolar concentration (MAC) for blocking adrenergic response (BAR) of sevoflurane in children with laparoscopic 
herniorrhaphy.
Methods: Seventy‑five children with 3‑7 years old scheduled for laparoscopic herniorrhaphy were randomly divided 
into group  R0, group  R1, and group  R2 according to different remifentanil plasma target concentration (0, 1, and 2 
 ngml‑1), respectively. The  MACBAR of sevoflurane was determined by the up‑and‑down and sequential method in each 
group. The concentrations of epinephrine and noradrenaline were also determined at corresponding time points.
Results: A total of 52 child patients were used among the anticipated 75 patients. In groups  R0,  R1, and  R2, the 
 MACBAR of sevoflurane was (3.29 ± 0.17) %, (2.12 ± 0.10) % and (1.29 ± 0.11) %, respectively, and a significant differ‑
ence was found among the three groups (P<0.05). The changes of epinephrine and noradrenaline concentrations in 
each group before and after insufflation of carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum showed no significant differences.
Conclusion: Remifentanil by target‑controlled infusion can effectively reduce the  MACBAR of sevoflurane during 
laparoscopic surgery in children. At a similar effect of  MACBAR, both the changes of epinephrine and noradrenaline 
concentrations are not affected by the infusion of different remifentanil target concentrations.
