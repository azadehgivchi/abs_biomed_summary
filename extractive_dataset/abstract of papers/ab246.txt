Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent and severe complication of sepsis contributing to high
morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. In this retrospective study, we develop a novel risk-predicted
nomogram of sepsis associated-AKI (SA-AKI).
Methods: A total of 2,871 patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) critical care
database were randomly assigned to primary (2,012 patients) and validation (859 patients) cohorts. A risk-predicted
nomogram for SA-AKI was developed through multivariate logistic regression analysis in the primary cohort while
the nomogram was evaluated in the validation cohort. Nomogram discrimination and calibration were assessed
using C-index and calibration curves in the primary and external validation cohorts. The clinical utility of the final
nomogram was evaluated using decision curve analysis.
Results: Risk predictors included in the prediction nomogram included length of stay in intensive care unit (LOS in
ICU), baseline serum creatinine (SCr), glucose, anemia, and vasoactive drugs. Nomogram revealed moderate
discrimination and calibration in estimating the risk of SA-AKI, with an unadjusted C-index of 0.752, 95 %Cl (0.730–
0.774), and a bootstrap-corrected C index of 0.749. Application of the nomogram in the validation cohort provided
moderate discrimination (C-index, 0.757 [95 % CI, 0.724–0.790]) and good calibration. Besides, the decision curve
analysis (DCA) confirmed the clinical usefulness of the nomogram.
Conclusions: This study developed and validated an AKI risk prediction nomogram applied to critically ill patients
with sepsis, which may help identify reasonable risk judgments and treatment strategies to a certain extent.
Nevertheless, further verification using external data is essential to enhance its applicability in clinical practice.
