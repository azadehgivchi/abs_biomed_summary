Background: Healthcare organisations have undergone organisational change to respond to COVID-19. This
pandemic has presented challenges for employee adjustment, with impacts on the availability and coordination of
human resources in healthcare. This study aimed to characterise the organisational actions regarding the
coordination of human resources in healthcare within Bogotá, Colombia, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: We followed a case study approach to understand the response to the emergency taking into account
the narratives of managerial actors who have been directly involved in the planning of guidelines oriented to face
the pandemic or in the implementation of health services for COVID-19. Twenty-two interviews with multiple
health system organisations within Bogotá were conducted between May and September 2020 and analysed
thematically.
Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis of the interview data: to retain human resources, to implement
actions to improve the mental and physical health of the healthcare workers, and to enhance healthcare workers
knowledge, skills and availability to respond to COVID-19.
Conclusions: Organisational actions led by hospital managers to retain, protect, and train human health resources
in the dynamic context of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified. Other system-wide organisations like scientific
associations contributed to the coordination of human resources across hospitals to respond to COVID-19 in
Bogotá, Colombia. The actions of hospital managers, and roles of system-wide intermediary organisations, in
coordinating human resources need to be explored in other health system contexts facing COVID-19.
