Background: Assessing the quality of healthcare data is a complex task including the selection of suitable measurement
methods (MM) and adequately assessing their results.
Objectives: To present an interoperable data quality (DQ) assessment method that formalizes MMs based on standardized
data definitions and intends to support collaborative governance of DQ-assessment knowledge, e.g. which
MMs to apply and how to assess their results in different situations.
Methods: We describe and explain central concepts of our method using the example of its first real world application
in a study on predictive biomarkers for rejection and other injuries of kidney transplants. We applied our open
source tool—openCQA—that implements our method utilizing the openEHR specifications. Means to support collaborative
governance of DQ-assessment knowledge are the version-control system git and openEHR clinical information
models.
Results: Applying the method on the study’s dataset showed satisfactory practicability of the described concepts
and produced useful results for DQ-assessment.
Conclusions: The main contribution of our work is to provide applicable concepts and a tested exemplary open
source implementation for interoperable and knowledge-based DQ-assessment in healthcare that considers the need
for flexible task and domain specific requirements.
