Background: Infuenza A virus (IAV) infection is a continual threat to the health of animals and humans globally.
Consumption of the conventional drugs has shown several side efects and drug resistance. This study was aimed to
screen some Iranian medicinal plants extracts and their fractions against infuenza A virus.
Methods: Glycyrrhiza glabra (rhizome), Myrtus commonis (leaves), Melissa ofcinalis (leaves), Hypericum perforatum
(aerial parts), Tilia platyphyllos (fower), Salix alba (bark), and Camellia sinensis (green and fermented leaves) were
extracted with 80% methanol and fractionated with chloroform and methanol, respectively. The cytotoxicity of the
compounds were determined by MTT colorimetric assay on MDCK cells. The efective concentrations (EC50) of the
compounds were calculated from the MTT results compared to the negative control with no signifcant efects on cell
viability. The efects of EC50 of the compounds on viral surface glycoproteins and viral titer were tested by HI and HA
virological assays, respectively and compared with oseltamivir and amantadine. Preliminary phytochemical analysis
were done for promising anti-IAV extracts and fractions.
Results: The most efective samples against IAV titer (Pâ‰¤0.05) were crude extracts of G. glabra, M. ofcinalis and S.
alba; methanol fractions of M. communis and M. ofcinalis; and chloroform fractions of M. communis and C. sinensis
(fermented) mostly in co- and pre-penetration combined treatments. The potential extracts and fractions were rich in
favonoids, tannins, steroids and triterpenoids.
Conclusion: The outcomes confrmed a scientifc basis for anti-infuenza A virus capacity of the extracts and fractions from the selected plants for the frst time, and correlated their efects with their phytochemical constituents. It is
worth focusing on elucidating pure compounds and identifying their mechanism(s) of action.
