Background: Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS) is a rare cause of hypoglycemia and is characterized by the
presence of insulin autoantibodies. Patients with IAS usually complain of hypoglycemia without any previous insulin
received. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants are used to treat IAS.
Case presentation: We report four patients with diabetes who were diagnosed with non-classical IAS and describe
the treatment of these patients. Moreover, the differential diagnosis with hyperinsulinism is discussed.
Conclusion: High levels of insulin autoantibodies, as well as hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, are found in patients
with diabetes mellitus and prior exogenous insulin exposure. This situation that we classified as non-classical IAS
should be attached importance to.
