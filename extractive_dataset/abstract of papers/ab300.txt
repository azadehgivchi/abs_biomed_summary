Backgrounds: An understanding of the oncology nurse spiritual care competence would help nurse managers recognize
weakness in spiritual practice and improve the quality of spiritual care. But the relationship between attitude
towards death and spiritual care competence is unknown.
Methods: We recruited 326 nurses from hospitals in Guangzhou, China. The nurses completed the Chinese Spiritual
Care Competence Scale and the Chinese Death Attitude Profile-Revised questionnaires.
Results: The total score of spiritual care competence was 61.62 ± 16.10. And the lowest score of attitude towards
death was for escape acceptance, 2.64 ± 0.82. Factors associated with nurse spiritual care competence were work
department, whether trained in spiritual care, approaching acceptance, and escaping acceptance of attitude towards
death.
Conclusion: Nurses need to perfect their spiritual care competence and establish positive attitudes towards death.
