Background: Little is known about associations of psychological and mental well-being with cognitive and socioemotional
factors in low and middle-income countries, particularly among vulnerable populations born in adverse
environments that may restrict developmental potential. This study aimed to examine the cognitive and socioemotional
correlates of psychological well-being and mental health in a cohort of Guatemalan adults born in contexts of
poverty and malnutrition.
Methods: From Dec 2017 to Apr 2019, data were collected from 704 women and 564 men ages 40â€“57 years living in
four rural villages in eastern Guatemala and Guatemala City. We measured latent domains of psychological well-being,
spirituality and religion, emotional support, and executive function using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Under a
Structural Equation Modeling framework, we examined intercorrelations among latent domains and observed measures
of intelligence and mental health.
Results: CFA supported the construct validity of factor structures in this population. Correlations of psychological
well-being with spirituality and religion were moderate in women (r = 0.68, p < 0.001) and men (r = 0.70, p < 0.001).
Executive function was weakly correlated with psychological well-being in men (r = 0.23, p < 0.001) and showed no
association in women. Correlations of psychological well-being with emotional support and IQ were weak in women
(r = 0.34, and r = 0.15, respectively; p < 0.001 for both) and men (r = 0.35, and r = 0.25, respectively; p < 0.001 for both).
Mental health and IQ were weakly correlated in men (r = 0.09, p < 0.05) and showed no association in women. Mental
health showed weak correlations with emotional support (r = 0.18, p < 0.001 in women; r = 0.09, p < 0.05 in men),
psychological well-being (r = 0.32 and r = 0.35, in women and men respectively; p < 0.001 for both) and showed no
association with executive function in both sexes.
Conclusions: Of all examined factors, spirituality and religion made the greatest contribution to psychological
well-being. These findings support the notion that in populations experiencing difficult circumstances, religion can
perhaps make a greater contribution to well-being and aid coping. More research is needed to examine mediators of
this association.
