Background: To understand how best to approach dementia care within primary care and its challenges, we examined
the evidence related to diagnosing and managing dementia within primary care.
Methods: Databases searched include: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and The Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews from inception to 11 May 2020. English-language systematic reviews, either quantitative or qualitative, were
included if they described interventions involving the diagnosis, treatment and/or management of dementia within
primary care/family medicine and outcome data was available. The risk of bias was assessed using AMSTAR 2. The
review followed PRISMA guidelines and is registered with Open Science Framework.
Results: Twenty-one articles are included. The Mini-Cog and the MMSE were the most widely studied cognitive
screening tools. The Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) achieved high sensitivity (100 %, 95 % CI: 70-100 %) and
specificity (82 %, 95 % CI: 72-90 %) within the shortest amount of time (3.16 to 5 min) within primary care. Five of six
studies found that family physicians had an increased likelihood of suspecting dementia after attending an educational
seminar. Case management improved behavioural symptoms, while decreasing hospitalization and emergency
visits. The primary care educational intervention, Enhancing Alzheimerâ€™s Caregiver Health (Department of Veterans
Affairs), was successful at increasing carer ability to manage problem behaviours and improving outcomes for
caregivers.
Conclusions: There are clear tools to help identify cognitive impairment in primary care, but strategies for management
require further research. The findings from this systematic review will inform family physicians on how to
improve dementia diagnosis and management within their primary care practice.
