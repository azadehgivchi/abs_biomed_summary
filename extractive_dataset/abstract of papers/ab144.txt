Objective: This study was designed for the first time to analyze clinical efficacy of bone transport technology in
Chinese older patients with infectious bone nonunion after open tibial fracture.
Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed 220 older patients with infectious bone nonunion after open tibial
fracture. There were 110 patients receiving bone transport technology (Group A) and 110 patients receiving
membrane induction technique with antibiotic bone cement (Group B).
Results: There were 164 male patients and 56 female patients, with an age range of 65 to 71 years and an average
age of 67 ± 1.3 years. Traffic accident, high-fall injury and crush injury account for 45.5, 27.7 and 26.8%, respectively.
Age, gender, histories, causes and fracture location had no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05
for all). Operation time in the Group A was significantly shorter than that in the Group B (P < 0.05). Linear and
positional alignment (70.9 vs. 57.3), American Knee Society knee function score (167.7 ± 14.9 vs. 123.8 ± 15.7), Baird-
Jackson ankle function score (89.9 ± 3.5 vs. 78.4 ± 4.9), bone healing index (43.0 ± 2.0 vs. 44.3 ± 3.0) and clinical
recovery (8.2 vs. 4.5) of patients in the Group A were significantly better than those in the Group B (P < 0.05 for all).
Wound infection in the Group A (7.3%) was significantly less than that in the Group B (16.4%; P < 0.05). There were
neither a neurovascular complication nor a recurrence of infection in the two groups.
Conclusion: Bone transport technology achieved better knee and ankle joint function recovery and superior bone
healing and clinical efficacy than membrane induction technique with antibiotic bone cement, suggesting that
bone transport technique is worthy of extensive promotion to improve clinical condition of older patients with
infectious bone nonunion after open tibial fracture.
