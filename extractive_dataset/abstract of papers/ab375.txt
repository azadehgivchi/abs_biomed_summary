Background: While sleep disruption is a common complaint among children with cystic fibrosis (CF), only a few
studies have investigated insomnia in adults. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with insomnia in
clinically stable adult CF patients.
Methods: Twenty-eight CF patients (18M/10F), with a median age of 27 (22–34) (median (interquartile range) years
and a median of forced expiratory volume in one second of 72 (39–93) % predicted completed questionnaires on
insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI), sleep quality (PSQI), daytime sleepiness (Epworth), restless legs syndrome
(IRLS), pain (NRS), anxiety/depression (HAD) and quality of life (CFQ-R 14+). Respiratory assessment data, including
symptoms, sputum analysis, arterial blood gases, 6-min walking test, pulmonary function tests and polysomnographic
variables, were also analyzed.
Results: Forty-three percent of patients were insomniac (ISI > 7). Compared with non-insomniac patients (ISI ≤ 7),
insomniac patients had more severely impaired quality of life and a higher HAD score: median anxiety score of 9
(8–11) vs 4 (3–6) (p < 0.0001), median depression score of 7 (5–10) vs 1 (1–4) (p < 0.001), with a positive correlation
between ISI and HAD anxiety/depression scores (r = 0.702/r = 0.701, respectively, p < 0.0001). Insomnia was also associated
with mMRC dyspnea scale ≥ 2, restless legs syndrome, pain and lower SpO2
during sleep.
Conclusions: The strong association between insomnia, impaired quality of life and increased HAD score should
prompt physicians to be particularly attentive to the management of anxiety and depression in adult CF patients with
insomnia.
