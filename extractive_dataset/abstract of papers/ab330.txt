Abstract: Background: Triage, identifying patients with critical and time-sensitive disorders, is an integrated process
in general emergency medicine. Obstetric triage is more specialised, requiring assessment of both woman, fetus and
labour status. Failure to identify severely ill obstetric patients has repeatedly led to maternal morbidity and mortality.
Reliable triage systems, adapted to obstetric patients as well as local conditions, are thus essential. The study aims to
assess the interrater reliability (IRR) of the Gothenburg Obstetric Triage System (GOTS).
Methods: Midwives (n=6) and registered nurses with no experience in managing obstetric patients (n=7), assessed
30 paper cases based on actual real-life cases, using the GOTS. Furthermore, a reference group consisting of two midwives and two obstetricians, with extensive experience in obstetric care, determined the correct triage level in order
to enable analysis of over- and undertriage. IRR was assessed, both with percentage of absolute agreement and with
intra-class correlation coefcients (ICC) with 95% confdence intervals (CI).
Results: A total of 388 assessments were performed, comprising all fve levels of acuity in the GOTS. Absolute agreement was found in 69.6% of the assessments. The overall IRR was good, with a Kappa value of 0.78 (0.69–0.87, 95%
CI) for fnal triage level. Comparison with reference group assessments established that over- and undertriage had
occurred in 9% and 21% of the cases, respectively. The main reasons for undertriage were “not acknowledging abnormal vital sign parameters” and “limitations in study design”.
Conclusion: The GOTS is a reliable tool for triaging obstetric patients. It enables a standardized triage process unrelated to the assessors’ level of experience in assessing and managing obstetric patients and is applicable for triaging
obstetric patients presenting for emergency care at obstetric or emergency units.
