Introduction: Diagnosing Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) involves damages to multiple joints and carries variable clinical
symptoms, posing great challenge to the diagnosis of KBD for clinical practitioners. However, it is still unclear which
clinical features of KBD are more informative for the diagnosis of Kashin-Beck disease among adolescent.
Methods: We first manually extracted 26 possible features including clinical manifestations, and pathological
changes of X-ray images from 400 KBD and 400 non-KBD adolescents. With such features, we performed four classification
methods, i.e., random forest algorithms (RFA), artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs)
and linear regression (LR) with four feature selection methods, i.e., RFA, minimum redundancy maximum relevance
(mRMR), support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVMâ€”RFE) and Relief. The performance of diagnosis
of KBD with respect to different classification models were evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area
under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).
Results: Our results demonstrated that the 10 out of 26 discriminative features were displayed more powerful performance,
regardless of the chosen of classification models and feature selection methods. These ten discriminative
features were distal end of phalanges alterations, metaphysis alterations and carpals alterations and clinical manifestations
of ankle joint movement limitation, enlarged finger joints, flexion of the distal part of fingers, elbow joint movement
limitation, squatting limitation, deformed finger joints, wrist joint movement limitation.
Conclusions: The selected ten discriminative features could provide a fast, effective diagnostic standard for KBD
adolescents.
