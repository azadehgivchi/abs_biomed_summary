Background: Coronary heart disease is one of the diseases with the highest mortality rate. Due to the important
position of cardiovascular disease prevention and diagnosis in the medical field, the segmentation of cardiovascular
images has gradually become a research hotspot. How to segment accurate blood vessels from coronary
angiography videos to assist doctors in making accurate analysis has become the goal of our research.
Method: Based on the U-net architecture, we use a context-based convolutional network for capturing more
information of the vessel in the video. The proposed method includes three modules: the sequence encoder module,
the sequence decoder module, and the sequence filter module. The high-level information of the feature is extracted
in the encoder module. Multi-kernel pooling layers suitable for the extraction of blood vessels are added before the
decoder module. In the filter block, we add a simple temporal filter to reducing inter-frame flickers.
Results: The performance comparison with other method shows that our work can achieve 0.8739 in Sen, 0.9895 in
Acc. From the performance of the results, the accuracy of our method is significantly improved. The performance
benefit from the algorithm architecture and our enlarged dataset.
Conclusion: Compared with previous methods that only focus on single image analysis, our method can obtain
more coronary information through image sequences. In future work, we will extend the network to 3D networks.
