Background: Oesophageal atresia (OA) is a life-threatening developmental defect characterized by a lost continuity
between the upper and lower oesophagus. The most common form is a distal connection between the trachea
and the oesophagus, i.e. a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). The condition may be part of a syndrome or occurs as
an isolated feature. The recurrence risk in affected families is increased compared to the population-based
incidence suggesting contributing genetic factors.
Methods: To gain insight into gene variants and genes associated with isolated OA we conducted whole genome
sequencing on samples from three families with recurrent cases affected by congenital and isolated TEF.
Results: We identified a combination of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), splice site variants (SSV) and structural
variants (SV) annotated to altogether 100 coding genes in the six affected individuals.
Conclusion: This study highlights rare SVs among candidate gene variants in our individuals with OA and provides
a gene framework for further investigations of genetic factors behind this malformation.
