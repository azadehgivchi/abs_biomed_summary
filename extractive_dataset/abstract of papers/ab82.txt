Abstract 
Background: This study aimed to evaluate atrium extracellular matrix remodeling in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients 
with severe aortic stenosis, through histological fibrosis quantification and extracellular matrix gene expression analyâ€‘
sis, as well as serum quantification of selected protein targets.
Methods: A posthoc analysis of a prospective study was performed in a cohort of aortic stenosis patients. Between 
2014 and 2019, 56 patients with severe aortic stenosis submitted to aortic valve replacement surgery in a tertiary 
hospital were selected.
Results: Fibrosis was significantly increased in the AF group when compared to sinus rhythm (SR) patients 
(p = 0.024). Moreover, cardiomyocyte area was significantly higher in AF patients versus SR patients (p = 0.008). 
Conversely, collagen III gene expression was increased in AF patients (p = 0.038). TIMP1 was less expressed in the 
atria of AF patients. MMP16/TIMP4 ratio was significantly decreased in AF patients (p = 0.006). TIMP1 (p = 0.004) and 
TIMP2 (p = 0.012) were significantly increased in the serum of AF patients. Aortic valve maximum (p = 0.0159) and 
mean (p = 0.031) gradients demonstrated a negative association with serum TIMP1.
Conclusions: Atrial fibrillation patients with severe aortic stenosis present increased atrial fibrosis and collagen type 
III synthesis, with extracellular matrix remodelling demonstrated by a decrease in the MMP16/TIMP4 ratio, along with 
an increased serum TIMP1 and TIMP2 proteins.
