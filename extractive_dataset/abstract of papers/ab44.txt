Background: Due to the scarcity of adequately powered, randomized controlled trials and internationally standardized
diagnostic criteria, evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is limited.
Earlier epidemiologic observations led to the attribution of PCS to the premenopausal state, and a remission of
symptoms after menopause is frequently described a hallmark of the pathology. This concept has currently been challenged
by radiological studies reporting a notable prevalence of ovarian venous congestion in adult female patients
of advanced age. PCS as a pathology of postmenopausal women, however, has not been acknowledged by systematic
research to date, impeding appropriate diagnostics and therapy for affected patients.
Case presentation: A 69-year-old postmenopausal patient presented with newly diagnosed dilated and insufficient
pelvic veins in combination with characteristic pain anamnesis, thereby fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of PCS. Interventional
coil embolization of both ovarian veins as a standard treatment previously described for premenopausal
patients was successfully performed, resulting in prompt alleviation of symptoms. The patient remained symptomfree
at the 18-month follow-up visit.
Conclusions: Given this first systematically documented case of a patient with postmenopausal symptomatic PCS
in the light of recently published data on the prevalence of ovarian venous congestion in patients of advanced age, it
may be assumed that PCS is not to be considered a pathology strictly limited to premenopausal state. Further clinical
studies expanding the diagnostic scope beyond menopause may help to substantiate evidence and subsequently
define standardized therapeutic approaches for affected postmenopausal patients.
