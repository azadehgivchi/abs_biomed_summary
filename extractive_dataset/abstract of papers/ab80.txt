Abstract 
Background: Limited data were available on the current trends in optimal medical therapy (OMT) after PCI and its 
influence on clinical outcomes in China. We aimed to evaluate the utilization and impact of OMT on the main adverse 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in post‑PCI patients and analyzed the factors predictive of OMT 
after discharge.
Methods: We collected data from 3812 individuals from 2016.10 to 2017.09 at TEDA International Cardiovascular 
Hospital. They were classified into an OMT group and a non‑OMT group according to their OMT status, which was 
defined as the combination of dual antiplatelet therapy, statins, β‑blockers, angiotensin‑converting enzyme inhibitors 
or angiotensin receptor blockers after PCI. Multivariable Cox regression models were developed to assess the asso‑
ciation between OMT and MACCEs, defined as all‑cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and target 
vessel revascularization. A logistic regression model was established to analyze the factors predictive of OMT.
Results: Our results revealed that the proportion of patients receiving OMT and its component drugs decreased over 
time. A total of 36.0% of patients were still adherent to OMT at the end of follow‑up. Binary logistic regression analy‑
sis revealed that baseline OMT (P < 0.001, OR = 52.868) was the strongest predictor of OMT after PCI. The Cox hazard 
model suggested that smoking after PCI was associated with the 1‑year risk of MACCE (P = 0.001, HR = 2.060, 95% CI 
1.346–3.151), while OMT (P = 0.001, HR = 0.486, 95% CI 0.312–0.756) was an independent protective factor against 
postoperative MACCEs.
Conclusions: There was still a gap between OMT utilization after PCI and the recommendations in the evidence‑
based guidelines. Sociodemographic and clinical factors influence the application of OMT. The management of OMT 
and smoking cessation after PCI should be emphasized.
