Spinal injuries are present in 16–31% of polytraumatized patients. Rapid identification of spinal
injuries requiring immobilization or operative treatment is essential. The Lodox-Statscan (LS) has evolved into a
promising time-saving diagnostic tool to diagnose life-threatening injuries with an anterior-posterior (AP)-full-body
digital X-ray.
Methods: We aimed to analyze the diagnostic accuracy and the interrater reliability of AP-LS to detect spinal
injuries in polytraumatized patients. Therefore, within 3 years, AP-LS of polytraumatized patients (ISS ≥ 16) were
retrospectively analyzed by three independent observers. The sensitivity and specificity of correct diagnosis with APLS
compared to CT scan were calculated. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by using the area under the ROC
(receiver operating characteristic curve) for sensitivity and specificity. Interrater reliability between the three
observers was calculated using Fleiss’ Kappa. The sensitivity of AP-LS was further analyzed by the severity of spinal
injuries.
Results: The study group included 320 patients (48.5 years ±19.5, 89 women). On CT scan, 207 patients presented
with a spinal injury (65%, total of 332 injuries). AP-LS had a low sensitivity of 9% (31 of 332, range 0–24%) and high
specificity of 99% (range 98–100%). The sensitivity was highest for thoracic spinal injuries (14%). The interrater
reliability was slight (κ = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.03). Potentially unstable spinal injuries were more likely to be detected
than stable injuries (sensitivity 18 and 6%, respectively).
Conclusion: This study demonstrated high specificity with low sensitivity of AP-LS in detecting spinal injuries
compared to CT scan. In polytraumatized patients, AP-LS, implemented in the Advanced Trauma Life Supportalgorithm,
is a helpful tool to diagnose life-threatening injuries. However, if spinal injuries are suspected, performing
a full-body CT scan is necessary for correct diagnosis.
