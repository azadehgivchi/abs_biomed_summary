Background: Forced migrant populations have high rates of trauma-related ill health, including post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). Physical activity (PA) is well-established as an effective stress reliever, while insufficient PA is
associated with adverse effects on both mental and physical health. The aim of this study was to examine the
prevalence of different levels of PA and its association with PTSD symptom severity, controlled for exposure to
torture, among asylum seekers in Sweden.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey study, with data from 455 asylum seekers, originating from Afghanistan, Eritrea,
Iraq, Somalia, and Syria, residing at large housing facilities across Sweden. Level of PA was assessed by the Exercise
Vital Sign and categorized as; Inactive, Insufficient PA, and Sufficient PA. Prevalence estimates for proportions of
different levels of PA were calculated. Analysis of variance were conducted to determine the association between
levels of PA and PTSD symptom severity, measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. Multivariable logistic
regression analysis was performed to determine the contribution of PA on PTSD beyond sex, age, and exposure to
torture.
Results: About half of the participants (53.3, 95% CI: 48.6–58.1) met the recommendations for Sufficient PA. One
third of the participants (33.3, 95% CI: 28.7–37.8) were insufficiently engaged in PA, and 13.4% (95% CI: 10.1–16.7)
were inactive. There was a significant difference in PTSD symptom severity between groups of asylum seekers with
different levels of PA (F(2, 316) = 23.15, p < .001). When controlling for sex, age, and exposure to torture, Sufficient PA
was found to be associated with less PTSD symptom severity compared to both Insufficient PA (B = 0.297, SE =
0.086, p < .001) and Inactive (B = 0.789, SE = 0.104, p < .001).
Conclusions: Insufficient PA was common among the asylum seekers and our findings suggest that more PA is
highly associated with lower PTSD symptom severity. An increased focus on assessment and promotion of PA is
justified and discussed as particularly pertinent considering the much extended time of asylum-seeking processes.
The results support previous evidence of PA as a potentially important factor in the context of PTSD and forced
migrants’ health.
Prevalence of physical activity
The level of PA, in total as well as stratified by sex and
age group, is presented in Table 2. About half of the participants
(53.3, 95% CI: 48.6–58.1) met the
recommendations for a sufficient level of PA. One third
of the participants (33.3, 95% CI: 28.7–37.8) were insufficiently
engaged in PA, and additionally 13.4% (95% CI:
10.1–16.7) were inactive.
The analyses indicated lower level of PA among
women than men, although CIs were more or less overlapping.
A possible difference between women and men
was found among those inactive and of younger age
(18–30 years), for whom the estimates were 23.7% for
women and 10.3% for men, but also here the CIs were
overlapping. No differences in prevalence of PA were detected
between age groups for the total population. Due
to skewed distribution and too small strata, stratified estimates
on basis of country of origin could not be reliably
provided.
Differences in PTSD symptom severity between groups of
asylum seekers with different levels of physical activity
Table 3 shows that there was a significant difference in
PTSD symptom severity between groups of asylum
seekers with different levels of PA (F(2, 316)= 23.15,
p < .001). Pairwise post-hoc tests showed a clear pattern of
associations, i.e., the Sufficient PA group had less PTSD
symptom severity compared to both the Insufficient PA
group (p = .004) and the Inactive group (p < .001), and the
Insufficient PA group had less PTSD symptom severity
compared to the Inactive group (p < .001).
In regard to symptom clusters of PTSD, as indicated
by the AIS and ANS, MANOVA revealed overall significant
differences in symptom severity between groups
with different levels of PA (Wilk’s ˄ = 0.868, F(4, 630) =
11.58, p < .001). Follow-up univariate ANOVA established
differences in regard to both the AIS (F(2, 316) =
20.06, p < .001) and the ANS (F(2, 316) = 22.07, p < .001).
Pairwise post-hoc tests showed a similar pattern of associations
for the AIS and ANS as with the HTQ in total,
i.e., the Sufficient PA group had less symptom severity
compared to both other PA groups, and the Insufficient
PA group had less symptom severity compared to the
Inactive group (all significance tests between p < .001
and p = .016).
Associations between physical activity, exposure to
torture, and severity of PTSD symptoms
As shown in Table 4, the first model in the regression
analysis revealed that being a woman was associated
with less PTSD symptom severity in comparison with
being a man (B = − 0.207, SE = 0.001, p < .038). No significant
association was found between age groups and
symptom severity. This model accounted for 2% of the
total variance in PTSD symptom severity.
In the second model, which in addition to sex and age
group also included exposure to torture, associations were
found between PTSD symptom severity and sex and
