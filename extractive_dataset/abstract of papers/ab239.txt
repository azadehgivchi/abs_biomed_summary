Background: Gait deviation and associated torsional problems are common in patients with cerebral palsy (CP).
Although femoral anteversion in CP has been extensively reviewed in previous studies, only a few studies have
focused on tibial torsion. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate tibial torsion in patients with CP and investigate
the affecting factors.
Methods: Consecutive patients with cerebral palsy who underwent 3-dimensional computed tomography for the
assessment of rotational profiles were reviewed. Femoral anteversion and tibial torsion were measured, and the
demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. A linear mixed model was implemented to overcome
the retrospective nature of the study.
Results: After the implementation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 472 patients were enrolled for this study.
With age, external tibial torsion increased, while femoral anteversion decreased. The factors affecting external tibial
torsion were increased femoral anteversion (p = 0.0057), increased age (p < 0.0001), higher Gross Motor Function
Classification System (GMFCS) level (p < 0.0001), and involved/uninvolved limbs of hemiplegia (p = 0.0471/p =
0.0047).
Conclusions: Older age, GMFCS level IV/V, hemiplegia, and increased femoral anteversion were the independent
risk factors of increased external tibial torsion; therefore, performing an imaging study is recommended for
assessing the extent of tibial torsion in patients with such characteristics.
