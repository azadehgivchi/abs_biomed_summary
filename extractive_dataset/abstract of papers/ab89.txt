Abstract 
Background: BRD4 and PIN1 have been described to be involved in inflammation and vascular endothelial cell dys‑
function, which in turn may increase pulse pressure.
Hypothesis: Genetic mutations within the BRD4 and PIN1 genes could affect the risk of high pulse pressure.
Methods: A total of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (BRD4: rs4808278; PIN1: rs2233678, rs2287838, and 
rs2233682) were genotyped in a cohort of 666 hypertensive patients and 232 normotensive controls with Chinese 
Han origin. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to screen the best interaction combi‑
nation among the four SNPs within the BRD4 and PIN1 genes and diabetes. Logistic regression analysis was performed 
to calculate the odds ratio (ORs) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for the association between the four SNPs.
Results: Adjusted for age, weight, waist circumference, drinking, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, high pulse 
pressure risk was significantly higher for carriers with the rs4808278‑TT genotype in BRD4 than those with wild geno‑
types (OR: 0.400, 95% CI: 0.217–0.737, P* < 0.05). However, we did not find any significant association of rs2233678, 
rs2287838, and rs2233682 in PIN1 with high pulse pressure susceptibility after covariate adjustment. GMDR analysis 
indicated a significant three‑locus model (P = 0.0107) involving rs4808278, rs2233678, and diabetes, the cross‑valida‑
tion consistency of the three‑locus models was 9/10, and the testing accuracy was 57.47%.
Conclusions: Genetic mutations within BRD4 (rs4808278) could affect the susceptibility to high pulse pressure in a 
southeastern Chinese population.
