Background: Several studies have observed the contribution of chronological age, biological maturation, and
anthropometric characteristics to sprinting performance in young soccer players. Nevertheless, there are no studies
that have analysed the contribution of these characteristics to running speed qualities in adolescent female soccer
players.
Objective: This study investigated age-related differences in sprint performance in adolescent female soccer players.
Also, it examined the possible influence of anthropometry [body mass and body mass index (BMI)] and biological
maturation [age at peak height velocity (APHV)] in sprint performance.
Methods: Eighty adolescent female soccer players [under (U) 14, n = 20; U16, n = 37; U18, n = 23] participated in this
study. Players were tested for 40 m sprint (each 10 m split times).
Results: Posthoc analysis revealed better performance in all split sprint times of older soccer players (U18 and U16)
compared with younger category (F: 3.380 to 6.169; p < 0.05; ES: 0.64 to 1.33). On the contrary in all split sprint times,
there were no significant changes between U16 and U18 (p < 0.05; ES: 0.03 to 0.17). ANCOVA revealed differences in
all parameters between groups, controlled for APHV (p < 0.05). In contrast, all between-group differences disappeared
after body mass and BMI adjustment (p > 0.05). Finally, the results indicate that BMI and body mass were significantly
correlated with 40 m sprint (p < 0.05; r: -0.31) and 20 m flying (p < 0.01; r: 0.38), respectively.
Conclusion: In the present playersâ€™ sample, body mass and BMI had a significant impact on running speed qualities.
