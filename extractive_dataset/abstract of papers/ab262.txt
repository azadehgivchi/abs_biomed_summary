Background: Military nurses should possess the competency to provide quality care in both clinical and military
nursing contexts. This study aimed to identify the competencies of military nurses in general hospitals.
Methods: A qualitative study was carried out using a qualitative content analysis. We purposefully sampled and
interviewed 21 nurses in general hospitals in China.
Results: The data analysis revealed 40 competencies, which were categorised into four main categories according
to the Onion Model. These categories were motive (mission commitment), traits (perseverance, flexibility, etc.), selfidentity of dual roles (obedience, empathy, etc.), as well as knowledge, skills and abilities (clinical and military
nursing knowledge and skills, basic nursing ability, professional development ability, leadership and management
ability).
Conclusions: Existing knowledge of competencies of military nurses in general hospitals is limited. A detailed
exploration of this topic can provide guidance for recruitment, competency assessment, and competency building.
