Background: Owing to the unsatisfactory results of antibiotic treatment alone, surgical resection is currently considered
as adjunctive therapy in patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). However,
reports regarding the outcomes of surgery vary considerably by institution. Here, we investigated the surgical outcomes
and risk factors associated with unfavorable outcomes after surgery.
Methods: We analyzed patients with NTM-PD who underwent pulmonary resection at Seoul National University
Hospital between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2020, and assessed the types of surgical procedures, complications,
and long-term outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors associated
with treatment refractoriness or recurrence after surgery.
Results: Among 67 patients who underwent surgery during the study period, the most common indication for surgery
was persistent culture positivity despite rigorous medical treatment (80.6%), followed by longstanding cavitary
lesions or radiographic aggravation (10.4%) and massive hemoptysis (4.5%). Among 53 patients with positive mycobacterial
cultures at the time of surgery, 38 (71.7%) achieved initial negative culture conversion, 9 (17.0%) of whom
experienced recurrence. Nine (13.4%) patients experienced postoperative complications, which were managed without
lasting morbidity and mortality. Female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–42.4;
P = .046), preoperative positive mycobacterial culture (aOR 5.87; 95 %CI 1.04–33.08; P = .045), and residual lesions (aOR
6.86; 95 %CI 1.49–31.56; P = .013) were associated with refractoriness or recurrence.
Conclusions: Pulmonary resection is a reasonable treatment modality for patients with refractory NTM-PD or major
complications such as massive hemoptysis. The potential risk factors associated with unfavorable outcomes included
female sex, preoperative positive mycobacterial culture, and residual lesions after surgery.
