Background: The preoperative evaluation is crucial for diagnosis and surgical plan of retroperitoneum ganglioneuroma
(GN). In this study, we reviewed a relatively large series of histopathological proved retroperitoneum GN cases,
summarized the imaging features and further depicted risk factors of increased surgical blood loss.
Methods: A total of 35 (18 male, 17 female) patients were retrospectively enrolled from January 2012 to June 2019 at
our institution. Among them, 24 patients had undergone CT scans and 19 patients had undergone MR examination
before treatment. The clinical and radiological features were analyzed and the relationships between image features
and surgical blood loss were evaluated.
Results: The media age of the involved 35 patients was 40 years (range, 14–66 years). The histological tumor size was
10.12 ± 4.56 cm for average. Retroperitoneum GN was relatively low density on unenhanced CT images and showed
delayed progressive enhancement on enhanced CT and MR images. The whorled sign could be seen in 14 patients.
The vessel encasement sign could be found in 17 patients. Univariate analysis revealed maximal tumor size measured
on axial image, maximal tumor size measured on coronal image, encasing one or both renal pedicles, encasing the
aorta and/or vena cava and whorled sign on MRI showed significant difference between the blood loss ≥ 400 ml and
blood loss < 400 ml group. Logistic regression further detected that maximal tumor size measured on axial images
(OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.02–1.24; P = 0.023) and encasing one or both renal pedicles (OR: 22.39; 95% CI: 1.35–372.99;
P = 0.030) were independently correlated with surgical blood loss.
Conclusions: Preoperative CT and MR imaging analysis was valuable for both diagnosis and surgical risk prediction
of retroperitoneum GN.
