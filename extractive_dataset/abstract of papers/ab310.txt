Background: Anti-seizure medication (ASM) treatment is one of the significant risk factors associated with abnormal
vitamin D status in epilepsy patients. Multiple studies have shown that adult epilepsy patients can exhibit vitamin D
deficiency. However, there are few reports investigating pediatric epilepsy patients. In this study, we aimed to identify
risk factors related to hypovitaminosis D in pediatric epilepsy patients in Thailand.
Methods: A cross-sectional retrospective cohort study was conducted in 138 pediatric epilepsy patients who
received anticonvulsants from April 2018 to January 2019. Demographic data, seizure types, puberty status, physical
activity, duration, and types of anti-seizure medications were analyzed. Patients with abnormal liver function, abnormal
renal function, and who received vitamin D supplements or ketogenic diet containing vitamin D were excluded.
Levels of serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) were measured.
Results: All 138 subjects were enrolled, the age ranged from 1.04 – 19.96 years; (mean = 9.65 ± 5.09), the mean
serum 25(OH) D level was 26.56 ± 9.67 ng/ml. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 23.2% and insufficiency was
47.8% respectively. Two risk factors—puberty status (OR 5.43, 95% CI 1.879-15.67) and non-enzyme-inhibiting ASMs
therapy (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.117-11.46)—were significantly associated with hypovitaminosis D, as shown by multivariate
analyses.
Conclusions: Our study reports the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in pediatric epilepsy patients in Thailand
despite being located in the tropical zone. These findings can guide clinicians to measure vitamin D status in pediatric
epilepsy patients particularly when they reach puberty and/or are using non-enzyme-inhibiting ASMs therapy. Early
detection of vitamin D status and prompt vitamin D supplementation can prevent fractures and osteoporosis later in
life.
