Background: Our pilot study has demonstrated improvements in health outcomes through participation in a new
sport, light volleyball (LVB), among older adults. In response to the promising results of the LVB pilot study and the
priority of allocating resources to the prevention of age-related fitness degradation by the Hong Kong (HKG)
government, the present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a LVB intervention on physical and
psychological health attributes among older adults at a larger scale in HKG.
Methods/design: This study will apply both quantitative and qualitative methods with a large sample
(approximately 315 participants). We will adopt a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to further evaluate the
effectiveness of a LVB intervention on health outcomes against a comparison group, Tai Chi (TC), and a control
group (C). Older adults will be eligible to join the intervention if they are (a) aged 65 years and above; (b) living in
the community independently; (c) absent of diagnosed cognitive impairment; (d) not regular participants in a
structured PA program for two years preceding the study; and (e) able to achieve a passing score on the Timed-upand-go test (TUG) and Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT).
About 315 participants will be randomly assigned into 3 groups in 1:1:1 ratio. LVB group participants will receive 16-
week LVB program; TC group will utilize a simplified 24-form Yang Style TC, and C group participants will be
instructed to maintain their normal daily activity and join regular non-exercise social gatherings. Measurements will
be collected before and after the intervention, and 6 months and 12 months after completion of the intervention.
Discussion: This intervention, if effective, will enhance older adultâ€™s physical and psychological health, and provide
the data and evidence to support policymaking in relation to future PA promotion for older adults.
