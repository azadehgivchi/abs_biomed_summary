Abstract 
Background: Short QT syndrome is a rare, inherited channelopathy associated with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) but 
the characteristics and prognosis of short QT interval (SQTI) in Korean patients remain unclear. This study aimed to 
determine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of SQTI in a Korean population.
Methods: Consecutive patients with SQTI from January 1999 to March 2019 in three university hospitals in South 
Korea were recruited. SQTI was defined as a Bazett’s formula‑corrected QT interval (QTc) ≤ 340 ms in serial electrocar‑
diograms. Age‑ and sex‑matched patients with a normal QTc and without overt cardiovascular disease were included 
in a 1:4 ratio. Clinical and ECG features and outcomes were compared between patients with and without SQTI.
Results: 34 patients with SQTI [age, 23.5 (21–30.5) years; 31 male] were followed up for 4.8 (2.0–7.8) years. Early repo‑
larization, tall T wave, and U wave were significantly more frequent in patients with SQTI than in those without SQTI. 
QT dispersion [44.0 (28.0–73.0) vs. 20.0 (12.0–35.0) ms, P < 0.001] was significantly wider and heart rate [52.0 (47.0–58.0) 
vs. 70.0 (62.3–84.0)/min, P < 0.001] was significantly slower in patients with SQTI than in those without. Atrial fibrilla‑
tion (AF, 11.8% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.030) and ventricular arrhythmia (VA)/SCA (8.7% vs. 0%, P = 0.007) were significantly more 
frequent in patients with SQTI than in those without. SQTI was significantly associated with AF [odds ratio, 5.911; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.257–27.808; P = 0.025] and VA/SCA.
Conclusions: In this subset of Korean population, SQTI was associated with AF and VA/SCA.
