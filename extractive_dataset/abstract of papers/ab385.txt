Background: The concept of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) as a unique connective tissue disease has
endured for half a century. Disease onset can be in adulthood (MCTD) or of juvenile onset (jMCTD) and is characterized
by overlapping features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymyositis or dermatomyositis (PM/DM) and systemic
sclerosis (SSc). No universally accepted classification criteria for MCTD exists, however agreed upon overlapping disease
features include the presence of high titers of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle antibodies (U1snRNP) in the
peripheral blood, Raynaud’s phenomenon, synovitis, myositis and swollen hands or fingers. Characteristic capillaroscopy
findings are commonly seen in MCTD and jMCTD, which may represent a crucial and key clue for classification as well
as prognosis in these patients.
Case presentation: We present a young male patient, with symptom onset as early as age 13, who was diagnosed
with MCTD at age 16 and found to have high titers of anti-U1snRNP antibodies, Raynaud’s phenomenon, synovitis, and
swollen hands and fingers. Most interestingly, his video capillaroscopy at diagnosis was abnormal and revealed an
active SSc-like pattern. His presentation and course are described.
Conclusions: We conclude that based on existing data, and as highlighted by this case presentation, nailfold video
capillaroscopy should be included as an early screening tool for the detection of microangiopathy in patients with the
diagnosis MCTD and jMCTD. Additionally, given its prevalence in this population at disease diagnosis, we recommend
consideration be given to nailfold video capillaroscopy as a potentially important classification criteria and prognostic
tool for jMCTD and MCTD.
