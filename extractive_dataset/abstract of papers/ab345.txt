Background: Despite the increased global interest from researchers in postpartum depression (PPD) and
postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder (PP-PTSD), studies of PPD in China have shown a wide range of
variability. Indeed, the prevalence and risk factors for PP-PTSD have received little attention in China.
Aim: To determine the prevalence of PPD and PP-PTSD in China, and to examine the relationships between a
range of sociodemographic, pregnancy-related, and newborn-related variables, and PPD and PP-PTSD.
Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 1136 women who returned to the obstetrics clinic for routine
postpartum examination were enrolled. The sociodemographic, pregnancy-related, and newborn-related
characteristics were collected. Social support, and PPD and PP-PTSD symptoms were measured by the Perceived
Social Support Scale (PSSS), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the Perinatal Post-traumatic
Stress Questionnaire (PPQ).
Results: The prevalence rates of PPD and PP-PTSD symptoms were 23.5 and 6.1%, respectively. A multivariate
model showed that the presence of PP-PTSD was the strongest risk factor for PPD symptoms and vice versa. Other
risk factors for PPD included low sleep quality, low social support and newborn’s incubator admission. In terms of
PP-PTSD symptoms, risk factors included the presence of PPD symptoms, non-Han ethnicity, and low social support,
while having one child was a protective factor.
Conclusions: This study addressed some gaps in the literature and provided a better understanding of PPD and
PP-PTSD in China, which may contribute to early detection and intervention. Attention should be paid to women
who are most susceptible to PPD and/or PP-PTSD, including those with low social support, low sleep quality,
newborn’s incubator admission, non-Han ethnicity, and women with siblings.
