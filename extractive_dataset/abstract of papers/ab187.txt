Background: Medical professionalism is a core aspect of medical education and practice worldwide. Medical
professionalism must be reinterpreted to adapt to different social/cultural/historical contexts. We conducted a
survey to examine the current understanding and perceived value of medical professionalism among Korean
physicians.
Methods: The survey was distributed to 950 physicians nationwide; 721 (75.89 %) completed surveys were returned
between 1 April and 31 July 2011.
Results: In their practice, Korean physicians prioritized the values and virtues of medical professionalism in the
following (descending) order: veracity, respect for patient autonomy, integrity, responsibility, altruism, and honesty.
Approximately two-thirds of physicians responded that medical professionalism is an element of their vocation.
When asked to choose the most important sets of attributes or virtues of medical professionalism from a provided
list, the top three sets (in descending order of frequency) were: “responsibility and duty,” “veracity, integrity, and
honesty,” and “rapport with patients and conversational skill.”
Conclusions: Korean physicians value moral duties, such as responsibility and veracity, more than they do moral
virtues, such as altruism and honesty with patients. It is presumed that physicians are under pressure due to
governmental regulation of the national healthcare system and have difficulty exercising their autonomy.
