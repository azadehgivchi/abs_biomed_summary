Background: Advance Care Planning (ACP) by Registered Nurses (RNs) has been emerging. However, there is limited
understanding about what RNs experience as they incorporate ACP into their practice. This study aimed to elicit the
experiences of ACP RNs with the implementation of a normalised ACP (NACP) service in hospital and community care
settings.
Methods: A qualitative descriptive study invited four ACP RNs who delivered a nurse-led NACP for a 6 months duration
at two hospital and two community health care settings in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The experiences
of the ACP RNs were captured through a semi-structured interview and weekly debriefing meetings. The interview
recordings were transcribed verbatim and the minutes of weekly debriefing meetings were utilized. Data were
analysed by two independent researchers using thematic analysis with the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) as a
methodological framework.
Findings: The ACP RNs were females with a mean age of 43 years old. Their nursing experiences ranged 2 to 25 years
but they had minimal experiences with ACP and had not attended any education about ACP previously. The following
four themes were identified in the experiences of the ACP RNs; 1) Embracing NACP service; 2) Enablers and barriers
related to patients and health professionals; 3) Enablers and barriers related to ACP RNs; and 4) What it means to be an
ACP RN.
Conclusion: The introduction of a NACP service into existing clinical systems is complex. The study demonstrated
the capacity of RNs to engage in ACP processes, and their willingness to deliver an NACP service with a raft of locally
specific enablers and barriers.
