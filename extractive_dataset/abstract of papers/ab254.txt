Background: Occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), whether isolated or in the setting of a tandem lesion
(TL) have a poor response to treatment with intravenous thrombolysis. Previous studies have demonstrated the
superiority of mechanical thrombectomy in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) following large vessel
occlusion, compared to standard intravenous fibrinolysis. The aim of our study was to describe endovascular
treatment (EVT) in AIS due to isolated ICA occlusion or TL.
Methods: We assessed the association between 90-day outcome and clinical, demographic, imaging, and
procedure data in 51 consecutive patients with acute isolated ICA occlusion or TL who underwent EVT. We
evaluated baseline NIHSS and mRS, ASPECTS, type of occlusion, stent placement, use of stent retrievers and/or
thromboaspiration, duration of the procedure, mTICI, postprocedural therapy and complications.
Results: A favorable 90-day outcome (mRS 0â€“2) was achieved in 34 patients (67 %) and was significantly associated
with the use of dual antiplatelet therapy after the procedure (p = 0.008), shorter procedure duration (p = 0.031), TICI
2b-3 (p < 0.001) and lack of post-procedural hemorrhagic transformation (p = 0.001). Four patients did not survive,
resulting in a mortality rate of 8 %.
Conclusions: Our study has shown that EVT in the treatment of AIS due to ICA occlusion is safe, and effective in
determining a good functional outcome. ICA stenting led to good angiographic results and therapy with a
glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor immediately after stent release did not result in a greater risk of hemorrhage. The use
of post-procedural dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with favorable outcome, without a significant increase
in hemorrhagic transformation.
