Background: Frailty has been associated with a risk of adverse outcomes, and mortality in patients with various
conditions. However, there have been few studies on whether or not frailty is associated with mortality in patients
with accidental hypothermia (AH). In this study, we aim to determine this association in patients with AH using
Japan’s nationwide registry data.
Methods: The data from the Hypothermia STUDY 2018&19, which included patients of ≥18 years of age with a
body temperature of ≤35 °C, were obtained from a multicenter registry for AH conducted at 120 institutions
throughout Japan, collected from December 2018 to February 2019 and December 2019 to February 2020. The
clinical frailty scale (CFS) score was used to determine the presence and degree of frailty. The primary outcome was
the comparison of mortality between the frail and non-frail patient groups.
Results: In total, 1363 patients were included in the study, of which 920 were eligible for the analysis. The 920
patients were divided into the frail patient group (N = 221) and non-frail patient group (N = 699). After 30-days of
hospitalization, 32.6% of frail patients and 20.6% of non-frail patients had died (p < 0.001). Frail patients had a
significantly higher risk of 90-day mortality (Hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25–2.17; p < 0.001).
Based on the Cox proportional hazards analysis using multiple imputation, after adjustment for age, potassium level,
lactate level, pH value, sex, CPK level, heart rate, platelet count, location of hypothermia incidence, and rate of
tracheal intubation, the HR was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.25–2.29; p < 0.001).
Conclusions: This study showed that frailty was associated with mortality in patients with AH. Preventive
interventions for frailty may help to avoid death caused by AH.
