Background: Given the increasing rates of childhood obesity in Alaska Native children and the understanding that
the most effective interventions are informed by and reflect the cultural knowledge of the community in which
they are implemented, this project sought to gather the wisdom of local Yup’ik and Cup’ik Elders in the Yukon-
Kuskokwim region of Alaska around how to maintain a healthy diet and active lifestyle.
Methods: Perspectives were sought through the use of semi-structured focus groups, which were completed in
person in twelve communities. All conversations were recorded, translated, transcribed, and analyzed using a
qualitative approach, where key themes were identified.
Results: Elders provided a clear and consistent recollection of what their life looked like when they were young
and expressed their perspectives related to maintaining a healthy and traditional lifestyle. The key themes the
Elders discussed included an emphasis on the nutritional and cultural benefits of traditional foods; concerns around
changing dietary patterns such as the consumption of processed foods and sugar sweetened beverages; and
concerns on the time and use of screens. Elders also expressed a desire to help younger generations learn
traditional subsistence practices.
Conclusions: The risk of obesity in Alaska Native children is high and intervention efforts should be grounded in
local knowledge and values. The perspectives from Yup’ik and Cup’ik Elders in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta area of
Alaska provide a better understanding on local views of how to maintain a healthy diet, physical activities, and
traditional values.
