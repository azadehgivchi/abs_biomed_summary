Background: The purpose of this study was to clarify the reliability and validity of pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength
assessment using the MizCure perineometer in healthy women.
Methods: Twenty healthy women (age 20–45 years) participated in this study. The vaginal pressure measured using
the MizCure and validated Peritron perineometers were repeated during PFM contraction in the supine and standing
positions. All women were evaluated twice by examiners 1 and 2. Following the measurements in the first session
(Test 1), they were repeated after an interval of between 2 and 6 weeks (Test 2). Within- and between-session intraand
inter-rater reliabilities in vaginal pressure were analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (1, 1) and
(2, 1), respectively. Validity was assessed by Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient and Spearman’s rank
correlation analysis.
Results: Within-session intra-rater reliabilities for both examiners 1 and 2 for all vaginal pressures in Tests 1 and 2
were 0.90–0.96 for both perineometers. Between-session intra-rater reliability for the MizCure was 0.72–0.79 for both
positions for examiner 1, and 0.63 in the supine position and 0.80 in the standing position for examiner 2. Inter-rater
reliability for Test 1 was 0.91 in the supine position and 0.87 in the standing position for the MizCure. The vaginal pressures
using the MizCure and Peritron were significantly associated with the supine position (r = 0.68, P < .001) and the
standing position (
rs = 0.82, P < .001).
Conclusion: MizCure perineometer is a validated tool to measure PFM strength in both supine and standing positions
in healthy nulliparous women.
