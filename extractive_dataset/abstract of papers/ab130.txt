Background: Up to 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis will undergo surgery resulting in an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis
(IPAA) or permanent end ileostomy (EI). We aimed to understand how patients decide between these two
options.
Methods: We performed semi-structured interviews with ulcerative colitis patients who underwent surgery. Areas
of questioning included the degree to which patients participated in decision-making, challenges experienced, and
suggestions for improving the decision-making process. We analyzed the data using a directed content and thematic
approach.
Results: We interviewed 16 patients ranging in age from 28 to 68 years. Nine were male, 10 underwent IPAA, and 6
underwent EI. When it came to participation in decision-making, 11 patients felt independently responsible for decision-
making, 3 shared decision-making with the surgeon, and 2 experienced surgeon-led decision-making. Themes
regarding challenges during decision-making included lack of support from family, lack of time to discuss options
with the surgeon, and the overwhelming complexity of the decision. Themes for ways to improve decision-making
included the need for additional information, the desire for peer education, and earlier consultation with a surgeon.
Only 3 patients were content with the information used to decide about surgery.
Conclusions: Patients with ulcerative colitis who need surgery largely experience independence when deciding
between IPAA and EI, but struggle with inadequate educational information and social support. Patients may benefit
from early access to surgeons and peer guidance to enhance independence in decision-making. Preoperative educational
materials describing surgical complications and postoperative lifestyle could improve decision-making and
facilitate discussions with loved ones.
