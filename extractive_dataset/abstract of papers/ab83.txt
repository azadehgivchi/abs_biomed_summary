Abstract 
Background: The study evaluated the cost of baroreflex activation therapy plus guideline directed therapy 
(BAT + GDT) compared to GDT alone for HF patients with reduced ejection fraction and New York Heart Association 
Class III or II (with a recent history of III). Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) is delivered by an implantable device that 
stimulates the baroreceptors through an electrode attached to the outside of the carotid artery, which rebalances 
the autonomic nervous system to regain cardiovascular (CV) homeostasis. The BeAT-HF trial evaluated the safety and 
effectiveness of BAT.
Methods: A cost impact model was developed from a U.S. health care payer or integrated delivery network perspec-
tive over a 3-year period for BAT + GDT versus GDT alone. Expected costs were calculated by utilizing 6-month data 
from the BeAT-HF trial and existing literature. HF hospitalization rates were extrapolated based on improvement in 
NT-proBNP.
Results: At baseline the expected cost of BAT + GDT were $29,526 per patient more than GDT alone due to BAT 
device and implantation costs. After 3 years, the predicted cost per patient was $9521 less expensive for BAT + GDT 
versus GDT alone due to lower rates of significant HF hospitalizations, CV non-HF hospitalizations, and resource inten-
sive late-stage procedures (LVADs and heart transplants) among the BAT + GDT group.
Conclusions: BAT + GDT treatment becomes less costly than GDT alone beginning between years 1 and 2 and 
becomes less costly cumulatively between years 2 and 3, potentially providing significant savings over time. As addi-
tional BeAT-HF trial data become available, the model can be updated to show longer term effects.
