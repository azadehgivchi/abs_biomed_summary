The Emergency Room (ER) is one of the most used areas in healthcare institutions. Problems with 
over utilisation and overcrowding have been reported worldwide. This study aims at examining the characteristics 
of paediatric ER visits, the rate of hospital admissions and its associated predictors at King Fahd Hospital of the 
University in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. 

Methods: This is a retrospective, medical record-based study. Variables included gender, age group, nationality, 
complaints, Triage level, shifts and seasons. Descriptive statistics were reported as frequencies/percentages. P-values 
were obtained through a Chi-Squared test while unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were estimated by binary 
logistic regression, where admission was considered as the outcome. 

Results: The total number of paediatric patients included was 46,374, and only 2.5% were admitted. Males 
comprised 55.4% while females comprised 44.6%. The most common age group were toddlers, and 92.4% of the 
total sample were Saudis. The most common complaint was fever (26.9%) followed by respiratory symptoms 
(24.9%). Only 7 patients (0.02%) were classified as triage I (Resuscitation), and most were triage IV (Less urgent) 
(71.0%). Most visits occurred during the winter months. Adjusted ORs showed that neonates had higher odds of 
admission (OR = 3.85, 95%CI = 2.57–5.76). Moreover, those presenting with haematological conditions showed an 
OR of 65.49 (95%CI = 47.85–89.64), followed by endocrine conditions showing an OR of 34.89 (95%CI = 23.65–51.47). 
Triage I had a very high odds of admission (OR = 19.02, 95%CI = 2.70–133.76), whereas triage V was associated with 
a very low odds of admission (OR = 0.30, 95%CI = 0.23–0.38). 

Conclusions: A low rate of hospital admission was found in comparison with other rates worldwide. This was 
mostly attributed to an alarmingly high number of non-urgent ER visits. This further emphasises the problem with 
improper use of ER services, as these cases should be more appropriately directed towards primary healthcare 
centres. Further studies to examine the impact of prioritising patients in the ER based on the identified predictors 
of hospital admission, in addition to the standard triage system, are suggested.
