Background: The aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of atelectasis assessed with computer tomography
(CT) in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the relationship between the amount of atelectasis with oxygenation impair‑
ment, Intensive Care Unit admission rate and the length of in-hospital stay.
Patients and methods: Two-hundred thirty-seven patients admitted to the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia
diagnosed by clinical, radiology and molecular tests in the nasopharyngeal swab who underwent a chest computed
tomography because of a respiratory worsening from Apr 1 to Apr 30, 2020 were included in the study. Patients were
divided into three groups depending on the presence and amount of atelectasis at the computed tomography: no
atelectasis, small atelectasis (<5% of the estimated lung volume) or large atelectasis (>5% of the estimated lung
volume). In all patients, clinical severity, oxygen-therapy need, Intensive Care Unit admission rate, the length of inhospital stay and in-hospital mortality data were collected.
Results: Thirty patients (19%) showed small atelectasis while eight patients (5%) showed large atelectasis. One hun‑
dred and seventeen patients (76%) did not show atelectasis. Patients with large atelectasis compared to patients with
small atelectasis had lower SatO2/FiO2 (182 vs 411 respectively, p=0.01), needed more days of oxygen therapy (20 vs
5 days respectively, p=0,02), more frequently Intensive Care Unit admission (75% vs 7% respectively, p<0.01) and a
longer period of hospitalization (40 vs 14 days respectively p<0.01).
Conclusion: In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, atelectasis might appear in up to 24% of patients and the
presence of larger amount of atelectasis is associated with worse oxygenation and clinical outcome.
