Background: Shaping ability of a file plays an important role during instrumentation in an endodontic treatment.
This study aimed to compare the shaping ability of OneShape (OS), Hero Shaper (HS), and Revo-S (RS) instruments in
simulated L-shaped canals.
Methods: Forty-eight simulated L-shaped canals were prepared to an apical size of 25 using OS, HS, and RS (all from
Micro-Mega SA, Besançon, France), (n = 16 canals/group) systems. The amount of resin removed after each canal’s
preparation was measured and compared after producing a composite image made from the superimposition of pre
and post-instrumented canals. Canal aberrations and the preparation time were also recorded. The data were statistically
analysed by using ANOVA, Tukey, and Chi-square tests.
Results: One file fractured during instrumentation in the RS group. A significant difference was found at the apical
end of the prepared simulated canal between the groups, with RS showing the least amount of resin removal
from the inner side of the canals and HS showing the highest amount of resin removal from the outer side (P < 0.05).
Regarding the total width of the canals after preparation, a significant difference was found between the groups at
the apical end and the straight portion of the canals, and RS removed the least amount of resin at the straight portion
of the canals (P < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were found between the different instruments regarding
canal aberrations’ incidence (P > 0.05).
Conclusions: All of the files showed a tendency to straighten the canals, whereas OS files maintained the original
canal curvatures well.
