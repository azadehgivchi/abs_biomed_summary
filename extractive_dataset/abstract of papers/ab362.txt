Background: Social distancing measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may profoundly impact young people’s
relationships. This study compared adolescent and young adults’ romantic relationships and sexual activity before
and after social distancing policies were enacted.
Methods: In June 2020, 351 youth participating in an ongoing intervention study in Fresno County, California
completed an online survey about their experiences related to COVID-19. The survey included open and closedended
questions about their romantic relationships, sexual activity, and online romantic or sexual interactions
before and during social distancing restrictions. We used the chi-square test of independence to compare
adolescent (ages 13–17) and young adults’ (ages 18–21) responses. Results were also compared to responses in the
intervention study’s baseline survey.
Results: One-third (37%) of youth were dating or in a romantic relationship and 28% spent time in person with a partner
early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Among those dating or in a relationship, 34% physically distanced from their partner due
to parental restrictions related to COVID-19. Youth also spent less time in person with their partners during the pandemic
than before. Although most youth (69%) were not sexually active before or during the pandemic, 22% had sex during the
social distancing period. Young adults were more likely to spend time with their partners and have sex during the
restrictions than adolescents. Most youth were not involved in sexting or online dating, before or during the pandemic.
Conclusions: Adolescents and young adults have continued to engage in sexual and romantic relationships during the
COVID-19 pandemic, although many reported physical distancing from their partners. Results suggest that youth
continue to need access to sexual health education and services during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
