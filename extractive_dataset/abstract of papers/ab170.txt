Background: Microsurgery training has become an important part of ophthalmology teaching and one of the
main topics of examination. Accurate and effective evaluation of microsurgery skills is vital for the training and
teaching of residents. In this study, we aimed to establish a pterygium surgery assessment scale for use by
ophthalmic residents and evaluate its reliability and validity.
Methods: Based on a literature search, experienced pterygium surgeons developed the preliminary scale according
to the standard surgical procedure. The preliminary scale and a questionnaire were sent to teaching and research
experts in the field for feedback. Face and content validity and reliability of the scale were determined by rounds of
modifications based on expert feedback. For construct validity, existing assessment scales were obtained and a
range of factors were tested.
Results: Nineteen expert surgeons completed the questionnaire and modifications were made until all surgeons
agreed on the final scale. Good construct validity was found by evaluation against 257 existing scales. For reliability,
280 evaluation scales were completed. Inter- and intra-rater reliability analysis both found Intraclass Correlation
Coefficient (ICC) > 0.8 for all items and total scores.
Conclusion: The pterygium surgery assessment scale developed in this study has good reliability and validity, and
is an effective measurement tool for the evaluation of ophthalmology residentsâ€™ pterygium surgical skills.
