Background: The movement of firearm across state lines may decrease the effectiveness of state-level firearm laws.
Yet, how state-level firearm policies affect cross-state movement have not yet been widely explored. This study
aims to characterize the interstate movement of firearms and its relationship with state-level firearm policies.
Methods: We analyzed the network of interstate firearm movement using Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms,
and Explosives firearm trace data (2010–2017). We constructed the network of firearm movement between 50
states. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to estimate the relationship between the number of a
state’s firearm laws and number of states for which it was the source of 100 or more firearms, adjusting for state
characteristics. We used a similar model to examine the relationship between firearm laws and the number of
states for which a given state was the destination of 100 or more firearms.
Results: Over the 8-year period, states had an average of 26 (Standard Deviation [SD] 25.2) firearm laws. On
average, a state was the source of 100 or more crime-related firearms for 2.2 (SD 2.7) states and was the destination
of 100 or more crime-related firearms for 2.2 (SD 3.4) states. Greater number of firearm laws was associated with
states being the source of 100 or more firearms to fewer states (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] 0.58 per SD, p < 0.001)
and being the destination of 100 or more firearms from more states (IRR1.73 per SD, p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Restrictive state-level firearm policies are associated with less movement of firearms to other states,
but with more movement of firearms from outside states. The effectiveness of state-level firearm-restricting laws is
complicated by a network of interstate firearm movement.
