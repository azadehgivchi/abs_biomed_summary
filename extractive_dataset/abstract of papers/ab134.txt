alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in recent years, but few related studies are available. Thus, clarifying the association
between the WHtR and NAFLD may be beneficial to the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.
Methods: The cross-sectional study population was from a large-scale health examination programme called ‘human
dock’ in Japan. In this study, 14,125 participants in this health examination programme were included. To understand
the association between the WHtR and NAFLD more intuitively, we grouped the WHtR values into quintiles and used
a multivariable logistic regression model to assess WHtR and its quintile with NAFLD risk. Moreover, we used the generalised
additive model to model the association between WHtR and NAFLD to explore their non-linear relationship.
Results: The prevalence of NAFLD among participants in this study was 17.59%, with an average age of
43.53 ± 8.89 years. After adjusting for all non-collinear covariables, we observed a 66% increase in the NAFLD risk per
SD increase in WHtR. Furthermore, in the quintile groups of WHtR, the participants in quintile 2, quintile 3, quintile 4,
and quintile 5 had 3.62-fold, 5.98-fold, 9.55-fold, and 11.08-fold increased risks of NAFLD, respectively, compared with
those in quintile 1 (Ptrend < 0.0001). Non-linear relationship analysis revealed threshold and saturation effects between
WHtR and NAFLD in which a WHtR of approximately 0.4 might be the threshold effect of NAFLD risk, 0.6 might be the
saturation effect of NAFLD risk. Additionally, subgroup analysis showed that the interaction between WHtR and BMI
was significant.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that in adults, the WHtR is associated with NAFLD, and the association is not purely
linear but non-linear, with significant threshold and saturation effects.
