Background: Previous studies showed that transitional care reduces the complication rate and readmission rate and
improves the quality of life in kidney transplant receipts, nevertheless, in fact there are no standard evaluation indexes
and debatable scientific of existing indexes in kidney transplant recipients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
construct an evaluation index system to assess the effects of transitional care in kidney transplant recipients.
Methods: Based on Omaha system, an initial evaluation index system about the effects of transitional care in kidney
transplant recipients was drafted by the literature review and semi-structured interview. Two rounds of correspondence
were conducted in 19 experts and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to calculate the weights of all
indexes.
Results: Five first-level indexes, sixteen second-level indexes, and forty-eight third-level indexes were selected in the
initial evaluation index system. The authority coefficient of two-round expert consultations was 0.90 and coordination
coefficients of indexes ranged from 0.24 to 0.34.
Conclusion: The established evaluation index system for the effectiveness of transitional care for kidney transplant
recipients was scientific and reliable. Furthermore, it would be a potential method to evaluate effects of transitional
care in kidney transplant recipients after further examination.
