Background: In 2016, Oklahoma launched “Shape Your Future – Rethink Your Drink” (SYF/RYD), an obesity
prevention health communication program targeting parents and caregivers of children. The aims of this study are
to compare sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption before and after the program and to report factors
associated with SSB consumption, knowledge, and attitudes.
Methods: This repeated cross-sectional study involved 2656 Oklahoma adults with ≥ one child under 18 years in
the home. Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated and the relationship between SSB consumption and
covariates of interest were examined using logistic regression techniques appropriate for survey data.
Results: Following the SYF/RYD program, SSB consumption decreased 18.6% (p = 0.0232) and heavy SSB
consumption, ≥ three SSB per day, decreased 42.9% (p = 0.0083). Factors associated with SSB consumption, 1 year
after the launch of SYF/RYD included high school education or less (AOR = 1.33 with 95% CI = 1.02, 1.73), fair or
poor health status (AOR = 2.02 with 95% CI = 1.47, 2.78), drinking less than eight cups of water daily (AOR = 1.77
with 95% CI = 1.39, 2.25), inability to afford healthy foods (AOR = 1.33 with 95% CI = 1.06, 1.67), and self-identifying
as American Indian/Alaska Native (AOR = 1.59 with 95% CI = 1.10, 2.29).
Conclusions: Health communication campaigns, such as SYF/RYD, are an evidence-based strategy for health
behavior change and likely contributed to the declines observed in SSB consumption. Important differences in SSB
consumption by population subgroups persist and have implications for future message development.
