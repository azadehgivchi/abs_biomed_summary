Background: Productions of metallo-Î²-lactamases enzymes are the most common mechanism of antibiotic resistance
to all beta-lactam classes (except monobactams) in Acinetobacter baumannii. MBLs are usually associated with
gene cassettes of integrons and spread easily among bacteria. The current study was performed to detect the genes
encoding MBLs and integron structures in A. baumannii isolates from burn patients.
Methods: This study was performed on 106 non-duplicate A. baumannii isolates from burn patients referred to
Shahid Motahari Hospital in Tehran. Antibiotic susceptibility of A. baumannii isolates was performed using disk diffusion
and broth microdilution method in accordance with the CLSI guidelines. The presence of class 1 integron and
associated gene cassettes as well as MBLs-encoding genes including blaVIM, and blaIMP were investigated using PCR
and sequencing techniques.
Results: In this cross-sectional study all (100%) of the A. baumannii isolates examined were multidrug resistant. All
isolates were sensitive to colistin and simultaneously all were resistant to imipenem. PCR assays showed the presence
of blaVIM and blaIMP genes in 102 (96.2%) and 62 (58.5%) isolates of A. baumannii respectively. In addition, 62 (58.5%)
of the A. baumannii isolates carried integron class 1, of which 49 (79.0%) were identified with at least one gene cassette.
Three types of integron class 1 gene cassettes were identified including: arr2, cmlA5, qacE1 (2300 bp); arr-2, ereC,
aadA1, cmlA7, qacE1 (4800 bp); and aac(3)-Ic, cmlA5 (2250 bp).
Conclusion: A high prevalence of MBLs genes, especially blaVIM, was identified in the studied MDR A. baumannii
isolates. In addition, most of the strains carried class 1 integrons. Furthermore, the gene cassettes arrays of integrons
including cmlA5 and cmlA7 were detected, for the first time, in A. baumannii strains in Iran.
