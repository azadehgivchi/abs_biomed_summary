Background
The infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), COVID-19, leads to
viral pneumonia and other organ manifestations like
renal and liver failure, myocardial dysfunction,
thrombotic complications, and neurologic illnesses [1].
The main cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission
remains lung failure. Older age, comorbidities, high sequential
organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, lymphopenia,
elevated troponin, and D-dimer have been
reported to correlate with poor outcome [2].
In the last years, point-of-care ultrasound has increasingly
been used to assess critically ill patients. Especially
lung ultrasound (LU) is becoming more important. The
sonographic signs e.g., B-lines, are useful in the diagnosis
of acute respiratory failure or circulatory shock. Furthermore,
LU can be used at the bedside of critically ill patients
to assess the efficacy of ventilatory treatments and
monitor the course of lung failure. It may also be used
to detect and manage respiratory complications such as
pneumothorax, atelectasis, and pleural effusions [3–5].
Several studies reported that LU findings correlate similar
to high-resolution computed tomography (CT) findings
with the clinical course of ICU patients treated for
respiratory failure [6, 7].
During the corona pandemic, LU was extensively used
in COVID-19 patients since the infection causes interstitial
pneumonia [8, 9]. Manivel et al. developed a protocol
(Coronavirus disease lung ultrasound in the
emergency department protocol - CLUE protocol),
which involves an anatomical parameter, the severity of
lung changes, and a physiological parameter (oxygen requirement)
to evaluate COVID-19 patients in the emergency
room [10]. Lichter et al. showed that lung
ultrasound score (LUS) at hospital admission strongly
correlates with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation
and is a strong predictor of mortality [11].
In this study, we analyzed whether LU performed at
ICU admission can predict the clinical course and outcome
of COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Study design and ethical approval
In this single-center retrospective study, we analyzed
prospectively and systematically recorded data of lung
ultrasound examinations. The study was approved by
the ethics committee of the medical faculty of the
Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) Munich, IRB
number 20–0227 and waived the need for informed consent
because of the non-interventional design of the
investigation.
Patient selection and data collection
Between 30/03/2020 and 10/12/2020, we studied all consecutive
adult patients with a positive polymerase chain
reaction assay for SARS-CoV2 in a respiratory tract sample,
admitted to the Internal Intensive Care Unit at
LMU hospital Munich, Campus Großhadern. There
were no exclusion criteria. Demographic data, comorbidities,
medications, and laboratory findings were collected
systematically. Baseline was defined as the day of ICU
admission. At the beginning of the pandemic, we established
a lung ultrasound protocol on our ICU for every
COVID-19 patient admitted. LUS was recorded at admission,
and in case of respiratory deterioration. All patients
underwent a comprehensive LU in the first 6
hours after admission. Respiratory deterioration was defined
as the need for intubation in spontaneously
breathing patients, including patients treated with highflow
nasal cannula (HFNC) and/or non-invasive ventilation
(NIV).
Follow-up and outcomes
All medical records were daily reviewed to obtain clinical
follow-up. Outcome analysis started at the time of
the baseline LU exam. ICU length of stay (LOS), length
of mechanical ventilation, and all-cause ICU mortality
were the endpoints of the study.
Lung ultrasound
LU was performed by the ICU physician on duty supervised
by a senior physician with expertise in LU recording
and interpretation with the same equipment (Venue,
GE Healthcare). Each exam takes between 3 and 5 min
(min) with the patient in a supine position. No change
in position was needed for the exam.
LU was performed on all COVID-19 patients admitted
to the internal ICU using an eight-value method
(four values for each lung) according to an adapted
version of the CLUE protocol [10]. This protocol recommends
scanning the chest systematically in 12
zones, six zones for the right lung (R1-R6) and six
zones for the left lung (L1-L6). Due to the limited
positioning options of our patients (mechanically ventilation,
severe lung failure, hemodynamically unstable),
we had to adapt the recently published
CLUE-protocol. Instead of 12 we systematically
scanned eight zones, we defined four zones for the
right lung (R1 to R4), and four zones for the left lung
(L1 to L4), see Fig. 1.
At each of the eight zones, LUS ranges from 0 to 3
points, with higher points allocated to severe lung
changes (see Table 1). A normal lung will have a total
score of 0 points. The worst LUS will be 24 points. All
patients were divided into two groups depending on the
LUS at admission: a low (0–12 points) and a high (13–
24 points) LUS group.
Statistical analyses
Continuous normally distributed data were presented as
means ± standard deviation (SD) and compared using
the Student’s t-test. Normal distribution was assessed by
the Shapiro-Wilk test. Non-normally distributed variables
were compared using the Mann-Whitney-U test.
LU scores in consecutive exams were compared using
the signed Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlation between
data was examined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient
or Chi2 test. P-values less than 0.05 were
considered to indicate statistical significance. All data
were analyzed with SPSS version 27 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY).
Results
During the study period, clinical data were collected for
42 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the Internal
ICU. Table 2 shows baseline characteristics and
LU assessments of all patients, as well as grouped by LU
severity. Twenty-four patients (57%) had a baseline LUS
of 0–12 points, and 18 (43%) had a LUS of 13–24 points.
The mean age was 66 ± 13 years and 69% were males.
Comorbidities were present in 40 patients (95%) with
hypertension (81%) being the most common followed by
obesity (57%), diabetes (33%), and medication with immunosuppression
(31%). Patients with high LUS suffered
significantly more often from hematological malignancies
(4.2 vs 27.8%, p = 0.033); in all cases lymphomas
under ongoing chemotherapy plus anti-CD20-treatment.
There were no differences in the laboratory findings, the
SOFA or APACHE II scores for both LU groups. The
values of pH (7.42 ± 0.09 vs 7.35 ± 0.1; p = 0.047) and
paO2 (107 [80–130] vs 80 [66–93] mmHg; p = 0.034)
were significantly reduced in patients of the high LUS
group. Furthermore, the duration of ventilation (12.5
[8.3–25] vs 36.5 [9.8–70] days; p = 0.029) was significantly
prolonged in this group.
None of the patients had a normal LU at ICU admission
or homogenous B-lines in all 8 zones. Patchy subpleural
thickening (n = 38; 90.5%) and subpleural
consolidations (n = 23; 54.8%) were present in most patients.
Pleural effusion was rare (n = 4; 9.5%). The mean
total LUS was 11.9 ± 3.9.
Twenty-three patients (54.8%) were not mechanically
ventilated at ICU admission. Eleven of whom worsened
over the course (after 2 (1–7) days) with the need for intubation
and invasive ventilation, see Fig. 2. In this patient
group, LUS worsened mostly with increasing evidence of
B-Lines, pleural thickening, and consolidations in the anterior
zones, see also Table 3. The change in LUS from
baseline (ICU admission) to clinical deterioration (day of
intubation) was significant (p = 0.02), see Fig. 3.
In our cohort ICU mortality was 29% (n = 12). Baseline
characteristics grouped by ICU mortality are shown in
Supplemental Table 1. Non-survivors had a significantly
increased SOFA (6.2 ± 3.4 vs 10 ± 3; p = 0.001) and
APACHE II score (18 ± 7.6 vs 24 ± 7.1), p = 0.022). There
was no difference in preexisting comorbidities in both
groups. Non-survivors had significantly increased values
of leucocytes (8.0 [5.5–10.3] vs 11.9 [9.3–15.4] G/l; p =
0.019), creatinine (0.9 [0.6–1.0] vs 2.0 [0.8–3.0] mg/dl;
p = 0.047), lactate dehydrogenase (381 ± 116 vs 483 ±
119 U/l; p = 0.016), interleukin-6 (79 [18.6–171] vs 233
[73–280] pg/ml; p = 0.019), high sensitive troponin
(0.012 [0.01–0.02] vs 0.053 [73–280] ng/ml, p < 0.001),
and brain natriuretic peptide (482 [174–1454] vs 1725
[797–11,652] pg/ml; p = 0.023). Furthermore, lymphocytes
(8 [5.0–10.8] vs 3 [2.3–7.3] G/l; p = 0.039), and albumin
(3.0 ± 0.5 vs 2.6 ± 0.3 mg/dl; p = 0.008) were
significantly decreased in non-survivors.
Values for paO2/FiO2 ratio (171 ± 61 vs 118 ± 65, p =
0.017) and pH (7.42 ± 0.08vs 7.34 ± 0.13, p = 0.017) were
significantly lower in the non-survivor group. Nonsurvivors
needed proning (p = 0.008) and ECMO therapy
(p < 0.001) significantly more often.
There was no difference in mortality between the LUS
groups in our cohort. But presence of pleural effusion
(p = 0.033) and subpleural consolidations (p = 0.020)
were each significantly increased in the group that died.
Discussion
COVID-19 primarily leads to viral pneumonia
with all stages of lung failure beneath other organ
manifestations [1]. During the COVID-19 pandemic,
several hospitals used LU to determine the
severity of lung failure and to support treatment
decisions [8, 12]. In this retrospective study, we
evaluated in 42 consecutive COVID-19 ICU patients
the potential of LU to predict clinical
course and outcome.
In our cohort, 24 patients were assigned to the low
LUS group, and 18 patients to the high LUS group.
Comparing the two groups there were no significant differences
between age, sex, SOFA, APACHE II score, and
all considered laboratory findings. This is surprising because
several studies have shown that changes in these
parameters are associated with higher severity of illness
[13–15]. Other studies demonstrated that higher LU
scores are associated with an increased disease severity
[11, 16, 17]. The lack of relation might be explained by
the differences in the studied cohorts. All considered
studies examined patient cohorts of all hospital departments
while our cohort consisted of ICU patients only.
As expected, pH and paO2 were significantly reduced
in the high LUS group confirming that LU reflects the
severity of lung failure which is in line with the findings
of Zhao et al. [18]. Furthermore, the duration of mechanical
ventilation was significantly prolonged in the high
LUS group whereas the length of ICU stay was not. The
LOS is not only affected by the course of lung failure.
Other organ failures like renal or liver, as well as circulatory
failure prolong the LOS. In the opinion of the authors,
these results show that LU score determined at
ICU admission can predict the clinical course of lung
failure in COVID-19 patients.
Twelve patients died during their ICU stay (29%). This
mortality corresponds with the mortality predicted by
SOFA (20–40%) [19] and APACHE II (25–40%) [20]
score. There was no difference in mortality between the
two LUS groups. One possible reason for these results is
that only four of the 12 patients died because of lung
failure. The main causes of death were bleeding complications
(in all cases under heparinization because of
ECMO) and sepsis with other focus than pneumonia. It
seems to be comprehensible that LU cannot predict
other causes of death than lung failure.
None of the COVID-19 patients in our study had a
normal LUS at ICU admission. All of these patients were
admitted to ICU due to respiratory failure with the need
for oxygen supplementation. Therefore, it is plausible
that no patient had a normal LU. Main findings of LU at
admission were pleural thickening and subpleural consolidations,
pleural effusions were rare, homogenous Blines
over all 8 zones were not seen. Interestingly, presence
of pleural effusion and subpleural consolidations at
baseline ultrasound examination were each significantly
increased in the group that died. In particular, pleural effusions
are not a typical feature of COVID-19 pneumonia
but could be associated with other comorbidities like
renal or heart failure that explain this result.
Other scientists have shown that laboratory parameters
like increased values of C-reactive protein,
interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-Dimer are
predictors of mortality in COVID-19 [21–24]. In our cohort,
levels of leukocytes, creatinine, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase,
interleukin-6, high-sensitive troponin, and
brain natriuretic peptide were significantly increased in
the non-survivor group, while levels of lymphocytes and
albumin were significantly lower.
In case of clinical deterioration with the need for intubation,
LUS was significantly increased compared to
initial LUS due to increased detection of B-lines, pleural
thickening, and subpleural consolidations, especially in
the anterior zones of the lung. These results show that
LUS can be used as a valuable monitoring tool to assess
the course of lung failure and can early recognize possible
deteriorations which is in line with the findings of
other research groups [11, 25].
Limitations
This study has certain limitations. It is retrospective,
based on data from a single-center and a small cohort.
Therefore, a selection bias has to be presumed
and data should be interpreted with caution. A larger
number of subjects could potentially identify other
characteristics associated with clinical course and
outcome.
Conclusion
In this retrospective study of 42 COVID-19 patients, we
report that lung ultrasound score assessed at ICU admission
can predict clinical course (increased days of invasive
ventilation with higher lung ultrasound score) but
not outcome. Lung ultrasound can be used as a valuable
monitoring tool to assess the course of lung failure and
can early recognize possible deteriorations.
