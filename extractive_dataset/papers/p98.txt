Background
Migraine affects 1 out of every 7 Americans annually
and is 2 to 3 times more common in females than males
[1]. The financial burden of migraine in the United
States is estimated to be $1533 per patient annually for
episodic migraine and $4144 for those with chronic mi-
graine. Costs are higher in vulnerable or underserved
populations, such as those who have low socioeconomic
status, the uninsured, and the unemployed [1].
While new migraine preventive and abortive treat-
ments are emerging, research shows that a significant
percentage of our patients are looking beyond standard
medical treatments and incorporating complementary
and integrative medicine (CIM) [2]. According to epi-
demiological studies, 30–82% of people with headache
use CIM approaches [3, 4], while only 43% of people

with headache discuss their CIM treatments with their
healthcare provider [2].
CIM is defined by the National Center for Comple-
mentary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) as treatments
that are separate from mainstream medicine but may be
integrated with it [2]. Mainstream medicine in migraine
treatments include conservative pharmaceutical drugs
such as acute abortive drugs (triptans, ergotamines etc.),
preventive medications (antidepressants, beta blockers
etc.) and over the counter medications (ibuprofen, Exce-
drin, naproxen etc. [5]).
NCCIH was previously called the National Center for
Complementary and Alternative medicine (NCCAM)
but was changed to NCCIH based on the escalation in
use of complementary approaches by Americans. NCCI
H more accurately reflects that Americans are no longer
using these approaches “alternatively” but rather in con-
junction with mainstream medicine [2, 3] Examples of
CIM are commonly divided into two main categories:
Natural products (herbs, vitamins, minerals and probio-
tics) and mind-body practices (yoga, acupuncture, chiro-
practic, meditation and massage therapy) [2, 3, 6]. Each
category is further divided into a subcategory of CIM
with meditation/yoga, herbal therapies, massage/chiro-
practic, and acupuncture being the top CIM in each cat-
egory, respectively.
In 2012, the National Health Interview Survey re-
ported on 88,962 American adults and 17,321 children
and found 33.2% of adults and 11.6% of children used
CIM in the previous 12 months [4]. Additionally, Ameri-
cans spent $30.2 billion on complementary health ap-
proaches during the same period.
Educated women with migraine are more likely to use
CIM [7]. Wells et al., used the 2007 National Health
Interview Survey (n = 23,393) to compare CIM use be-
tween adults with and without migraine/severe headache
[2]. 49.5% of patients with migraine/severe headache
used at least 1 Integrative treatment in the previous 12
months compared to 33.9% of patients without mi-
graine/severe
headache
[2].
Researchers
noted
that
adults with migraine/severe headache used CIM more
often for treatment because: their provider recom-
mended it, mainstream treatment was ineffective, or
mainstream treatment was too expensive [2].
Similarly, Rhee et al. used the 2012 National Health
Interview Survey to estimate the prevalence rates of
CIM use in adults with migraine/severe headache (n =
4447) and the reason behind their use (wellness, treat-
ment or both) [6]. 41.3% of patients with migraine/se-
vere headache stated they used CIM in the previous 12
months [6]. 29.6% used CIM for wellness only, 11.4% for
treatment of migraine/severe headache and 59% for both
wellness and treatment [6]. These data also show that
only
31.3%
of
patients
reported
that
a
provider
recommended CIM [8] and that fewer than 50% of
adults with migraine/severe headaches discuss CIM use
with their healthcare provider [2].
To our knowledge, there are no publications using so-
cial media to investigate integrative methods used by mi-
graine patients for treatment. Yuan et al. [9] created an
online research account and associated hashtags on twit-
ter to recruit individuals to a survey about HIV clinical
outcomes. They found social media to be indispensable
for recruitment and found it efficient and cost-effective.
Online recruitment and social media strategies are par-
ticularly used for recruiting individuals that are hard to
reach, unable to spend extra time in the office to answer
research questions or those hard to engage through trad-
itional means.
The purpose of this study was to assess the attitudes
toward CIM among people with migraine in a social
media group, to identify which CIM modalities are being
used and to determine what patients considered to be
the most effective CIM modalities.
Methods
Study design
This was a cross-sectional web-based survey study of
people with migraine who have used CIM to treat and
manage migraine. This cross-sectional survey study was
conducted from January 2019 to March 2019 in collab-
oration with the American Migraine Foundation (AMF)
and Yakkety Yak. The AMF and Yakkety Yak, a digital
marketing agency, launched the nationwide #MoveA-
gainstMigraine campaign in 2017 to mobilize and em-
power people living with migraine. This initiative led to
the creation of the Move Against Migraine (MAM)
Facebook group for migraine patients to advocate on be-
half of themselves, to understand treatment options, to
access resources to manage migraine symptoms, and to
connect with leading doctors and researchers. During
January of 2019, the group had approximately 18,000
members.
Using literature review and clinical knowledge, two
board-certified headache specialists,(DEK and RPC) de-
veloped a survey instrument that included questions
based on the existing literature surrounding evidence
based CIM for the treatment of migraine. The first part
of study questions served to obtain demographic data,
confirm a diagnosis of migraine and characterize epi-
sodic versus chronic migraine. The second part of study
questions focused specifically on the CIM approaches
used and their perceived effectiveness. The third part of
the survey focused on the credentials of the provider giv-
ing the participant CIM guidance, if they reported hav-
ing guidance, and if CIM approaches are used in
conjunction with mainstream medicine.

Survey administration
This cross-sectional study was conducted using struc-
tured surveys; the main goal being to seek input from
respondents about their experiences with CIM for mi-
graine treatment. Consent was first obtained from pa-
tients in order to participate in the survey. Anyone
part of the (MAM) group was able to see the follow-
ing post, and click on it if they wanted to participate:
“Are you a migraine patient over the age of 18 who is
living with migraine and using integrative remedies
not prescribed by your physician (acupuncture, Coen-
zyme Q, cannabinoids, massage therapy, etc.)? Dr.
Deena Kuruvilla, a headache specialist from Yale
School of Medicine, is conducting a survey on the use
of integrative medicines/therapies for migraines, and
we need your help. Please click here to participate.”
Yakkety Yak posted our 17-question survey to the
MAM Facebook community, for 2 months with repost-
ing of the survey every 2 weeks. The survey was volun-
tary, and no incentive was offered for completing it.
Permission was obtained from The AMF, Yakkety Yak
and the Yale University institutional review board to
post our survey on social media.
This study was submitted for review to the IRB and
was granted an exemption. When the participant clicked
to participate in the survey, the first screen was a con-
sent. They clicked a box in order to obtain their permis-
sion to complete the survey. While we specifically
introduced our survey with migraine and integrative
medicine in our social media link, we did have partici-
pants click on the link to confirm that they have not
used integrative medicine. While Yakkety Yak posted the
survey link on the group page, the survey itself was
hosted on Qualtrics. Yakkety Yak did not have access to
the collected data.
Qualtrics is an online survey platform developed in
Provo, Utah, United States to create, test and share
surveys in real time. Qualtrics provides tools that can
be
used
to
configure
survey
properties
and
to
customize privacy settings, so respondents cannot be
tracked to an IP or email address, name, ticket num-
ber, etc., which allows for anonymous responses. With
these mechanisms as well as University firewall pro-
tected equipment, patient information was protected
from unauthorized access. The data collected were
used to better understand the integrative treatment
methods used by migraine patients and to identify
which methods are felt to be the most helpful. If any
data were missing from participants, the participant
survey was excluded using Qualtrics. Qualtrics has
software in place to prevent repeat survey submission
by the same individual.
Statistical analysis
The percentage of respondents selecting each category is
reported. For a 95% confidence level, we estimated a
margin of error using +/−(1/√N), where N is the sample
size [10]. With our sample size of 335, we estimated a
5% margin of error. This analysis was descriptive in na-
ture and therefore no formal hypothesis testing was
conducted.
Results
A total of 412 migraine patients responded to the survey.
Of the 412 patients, only 377 (91.5%) completed the sur-
vey in its entirety. 5 (1.3%) patients were never diag-
nosed with migraine by a medical professional, leaving
372 (99%) clinically diagnosed with migraine. 335 out of
the 372 (90%) answered yes to “Do you use Complemen-
tary and Integrative Medicine (CIM) approaches to treat
migraine.” 37 (9.9%) responded no to the above ques-
tion. Of the patients who use CIM, 316 (94.3%) were fe-
male and 17 (5%) were male. Further demographics can
be reviewed in Table 1. 247 users (73.7%) met the Inter-
national Classification of headache disorders, 3rd edition
(ICHD-3) diagnosis of chronic migraine while 87 users
(25.9%) met criteria for episodic migraine. Specific ques-
tions were asked in the survey to differentiate episodic
migraine and chronic migraine. 291 (86.6%) patients
used CIM in combination with mainstream migraine
treatments. Regarding how patients are seeking guidance
for their CIM treatments, 68 (20.2%) are being managed
by a healthcare provider,24 (7.1%) patients utilize the
internet, 12 (3.5%) seek help from a fellow person with
migraine, 4 (1.1%) from a Naturopathic provider, and
193 (57.6%) from 2 or more of the above.
Patients were asked which category of CIM (Meditation,
relaxation, deep breathing exercises, acupuncture, guided
imagery, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback,
mindfulness training, craniosacral therapy, or migraine
specific supplements/vitamins) they use. 19 (5.6%) patients
use meditation, relaxation, breathing exercises, and/or
guided imagery. 9 (2.6%) selected cognitive behavioral
therapy, 2 (.59%) patients use craniosacral therapy, 4
(1.19%) use mindfulness training, 2 (.59%) selected bio-
feedback, 9 patients (2.6%) selected yoga, 63 (18.8%) se-
lected vitamins, 189 (56.4%) patients answered that they
use 2 or more of the above, and 45 (13.4%) selected other.

24 (5.9%) patients reported CIM treatments were very
effective (50–100% reduction in headache days), 92
(22.6% selected moderately effective (10–50% reduction),
139 (34.1%) slightly effective (1–10% reduction in head-
ache days), 76 (18.6%) selected not effective at all (no
change in headache days) and 76 (18.6%) did not
answer.
With respect to nutraceutical use, 4 patients (1.19%)
used Riboflavin, 78 (23.2%) use Magnesium, 4 (1.19%) se-
lected Coenzyme q10, 1 (.298%) selected Butterbur, 15
(4.47%) selected other, 209 (62%) used a combination of 2
or more. 22 patients (6.56%) did not use any vitamin. Of
those who used vitamins, 12 (3.58%) patients felt the vita-
mins were very effective (50–100% reduction in headache
days), 58 (17.3%) selected moderately effective (10–50%
reduction), 132 (39.4%) slightly effective (1–10% reduction
in headache days), 109 (32.5%) not effective at all (no
change in headache days) and 24 (7.1%) did not answer.
Although 10.7% of patients do not use any manipula-
tion or body-based practices for migraine prevention,
most (55.5%) use 2 or more therapies in combination.
Of the individual therapies, participants reported using
massage therapy was most frequently used (12.5%), then
chiropractic maneuvers (9.2%), next acupuncture (9.0%--
note: round all numbers to the same decimal point).
Craniosacral therapy was minimally used (1.2%) as well
as “other” therapies (1.7%). 27 (8.0%) patients answered
that manipulation and/or body-based practices were very
effective (50–100% reduction in headache days), 75
(22.3%) selected moderately effective (10–50% reduc-
tion), 114 (34%) patients selected slightly effective (1–
10% reduction in headache days), 81 (24.1%) patients se-
lected this CIM was not effective at all (no change in
headache days) and 38 (11.3%) did not answer.
Finally, the survey ended with two questions regarding
cannabinoids and their perceived effectiveness in pre-
venting migraine. 164 (48.9%) use cannabidiol oil (CBD)
or other cannabis derivative to prevent migraine and 171
(51%) selected no to this question. 4 (2.4%) of the 164
patients found CBD or other cannabis derivatives ex-
tremely effective; 14 (8.5%) found these products very ef-
fective
(50–100%
reduction
in
headache
days),
36
(21.9%) selected moderately effective (10–50% reduc-
tion); 43 (26.2%) found them slightly effective (1–10%
reduction in headache days); 64 (39%) patients found
CBD or other cannabis derivatives not effective at all (no
change in headache days).
Discussion
Study findings
Our study is the first of its kind to identify social media
as a vehicle to investigate common CIM approaches
used by migraine patients for headache relief. There
have however been other online survey studies. Lee et al.
administered a 30-min self-report survey on an online
migraine headache resource (Migraine in America, www.
migraine.com) to investigate if CIM produced a negative
life impact of headaches for chronic migraine patients
[11]. They found that approximately half of the partici-
pants reported using three CIM treatments and yet, felt
dissatisfied or indifferent to their treatment strategy [11].
They also found that migraine patients who use CIM
were more likely to have more frequent migraine head-
aches [11].
With a 95% confidence interval, our study shows that
a true mean lies between the 95% of the values we have
acquired, and only a 5% possibility that it does not. Only
20.2% of participants in our study seek guidance for
their CIM strategies specifically by a healthcare provider
(MD, DO, NP, PA), while over 50% of patients seek
guidance using multiple other strategies such as research
the internet, guidance from a fellow migraine sufferer, or
guidance from a Naturopathic provider. It is crucial that
physicians query patients about their use of herbs, sup-
plements, and vitamins with their standard treatment,
provide realistic expectations, and identify potential
treatment adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and
existing evidence base. Patients using butterbur for
example [12], must be counseled to obtain pyrrolizidine-
alkaloid-free formulations due to the potential for hep-
atotoxicity. Liver function must be closely monitored
while using this supplement.
In combination with supplements such as magnesium
and riboflavin for the prevention of migraine, many pa-
tients used meditation, relaxation, acupuncture, deep
breathing exercises, guided imagery, yoga, cognitive be-
havioral therapy, biofeedback, mindfulness training, and
craniosacral therapy concurrently with the majority
(56.4%) using 2 or more of these treatments.
Of those, 76.7% of respondents found the combination
of CIM treatments moderately to very effective. This find-
ing supports the existing literature that these strategies are
favorably used in combination among the general popula-
tion [13] and in other select populations [14–16].
The evidence for using mind-body relaxation tech-
niques recommended by the US Headache Consortium
Guidelines [17] is based on the Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research Technical Review, which found re-
laxation training (progressive muscle relaxation, auto-
genic
training,
meditation
or
passive
relaxation),
electromyography (EMG) biofeedback, and thermal bio-
feedback combined with relaxation training to have high
quality (Grade A) evidence from well-performed re-
search studies for the prevention of migraine [18]. Mind-
fulness training always differs from meditation through
the practice of both informal and formal self-reflection
during the day, while meditation is defined to be during
a specific time of day at a specific place.

From our study, 30.3% of patients found perceived ma-
nipulation or body-based practices such as acupuncture,
chiropractic maneuvers, etc. alone provided moderately
to very effective treatment.
Finally, only 30.4% of respondent patients using canna-
bis as a treatment for moderate/severe migraine found it
moderately to very effective. As early as the third and
fourth centuries BCE, Ayurvedic preparations used can-
nabis for “diseases of the head” like migraine [19]. It is
postulated that cannabis shows potential to interrupt
glutamate signaling leading to cortical spreading depres-
sion, serotonin release from platelets and cranial blood
vessel dilation caused by nitrous oxide and calcitonin
gene-related peptide [20].
Medical cannabis is becoming a popular addition to
mainstream pharmaceutical therapies due to rapidly
changing
marijuana
laws
and
increased
availability
throughout the country. While some studies have shown
a possible benefit of cannabis for the treatment of mi-
graine [21] and medication overuse headache [21], prop-
erly constructed placebo-controlled trials are required to
determine its true efficacy and adverse effects.
If patients and providers can have shared goals about in-
tegrative medicine use in migraine, they can have an open,
non-judgmental dialogue about the risks and benefits of
various approaches. The C.A.R.E mnemonic [22] can be
used when discussing CIM approaches with patients. Pa-
tients may have a specific perspective regarding treatment
options based on their previous treatment experiences. It
can be helpful to ask about their history with conventional
treatments while also avoiding judgement. When review-
ing integrative treatment options, it is imperative to
counsel patients on their limitations so that they have ap-
propriate expectations. Finally, in order to adequately edu-
cate patients on CIM, it is helpful to explore where the
patient’s interest in CIM stems from. See Table 2.

Page 5 of 7
Many patients use CIM because it fits in with their at-
titudes about health [23]; addressing these beliefs, as well
as potential benefits and complications, will improve
patient-provider
communication
and
more
patient-
centered care.
Study limitations
The survey focused primarily on effectiveness of CIM
based on frequency of headaches and not severity.
Hence, this study cannot be generalized to include im-
provement in severity over time.
Selection bias is inherent in all social media – based
studies. We were only able to capture data from those
patients who are currently active in the Facebook group
being polled. This limits the data applicability to the
wider migraine audience, of which a small portion may
be overrepresented in this group. Other biases may be
introduced by unforeseen variables.
Although we had posted on the Facebook group, our
findings cannot represent a true population average be-
cause not every single MAM member who uses CIM
filled out the survey. Sources of bias in representing the
general population include a poor survey response rate
and differences in the patient characteristics of MAM
compared to the general population.
Subjective biases are also inherent in self-reported out-
come measures. Respondents may have misinterpreted
the question and may threaten the validity and reliability
of measurement. While the lines of communication were
always open between respondents and the headache
team to address any questions, few respondents took ad-
vantage. However, some of the advantages of self-
reported outcome measures is its relatively easy collec-
tion and at a low-cost for researchers.
We cannot regulate which users take part in the sur-
vey. The survey has questions designed to obtain infor-
mation from patients who have a history or diagnosis of
migraine; however, this cannot be confirmed. This is an
unavoidable side effect of anonymous polling and may
impact the reliability of the data. Although participants
were advised to complete the survey once, the number
of times the survey could have been completed by an in-
dividual was not regulated since the survey was anonym-
ous through Qualtrics. The data presented in the text as
well as the tables indicate “2 or more therapies in com-
bination”. We did not investigate which therapies were
used in combinations.
This survey had not been previously validated or ap-
plied previously in studies. The study is also limited by a
small sample size, a disproportionately large percentage
of Caucasian female participants, and a predominantly
chronic migraine population which is not representative
of the larger migraine population within the United
States. Many chronic migraine patients turn to CIM
because they have been refractory to mainstream treat-
ments. For this reason, the data in this study regarding
patient responsiveness to CIM treatments must be inter-
preted with caution as many of the survey respondents
may have been refractory to mainstream treatments.
The
responses
seen
in
this
survey
may
not
be
generalizable to the average patient.
Future research
Larger survey studies are needed to gain a broader per-
spective of CIM use among people with migraine.
Conclusion
This study uses social media to survey people with mi-
graine and gain their perspectives on various CIM treat-
ments. 90% of people surveyed reported using CIM for
the treatment of migraine. 74% of participants met the
diagnostic criteria for chronic migraine and 26% of partici-
pants met the diagnostic criteria for episodic migraine.
Most patients (86%) reported using CIM in combination
with mainstream migraine treatments. While this sample
of people with migraine may not reflect CIM use among
the general migraine population, it encourages healthcare
providers to conduct solid research studies specifically
using CIM for migraine treatment, increase CIM educa-
tion among healthcare providers and specifically ask pa-
tients about their interest in and use of CIM.
