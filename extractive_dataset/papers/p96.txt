Background
Trypanosoma cruzi is a hemoflagellate protozoan (Class
Kinetoplastida, family Trypanosomatidae), and the etio-
logic agent of Chagas disease (CD), also known as
American trypanosomiasis [1]. Currently, this anthropo-
zoonosis affects more than 7 million people worldwide,
and is considered a neglected and endemic tropical dis-
ease in 21 Latin American countries [2]. In Brazil, the
prevalence of the disease varies from 1.9 to 4.6 million
people infected with T. cruzi. In the period of 2008–
2017, cases of acute CD were recorded in most Brazilian
states, 95% of them were concentrated in the northern
region of the country and 72% were acquired orally due
to the ingestion of food contaminated with the triato-
mine insect vector [3].
The treatment of this infection is still considered chal-
lenging, as it is restricted to two nitroderivatives, benzni-
dazole (BZ) and nifurtimox, both of which have limited
efficacy, especially in the chronic phase of the disease, in
addition to severe side effects [4]. In Brazil, BZ is the
only drug used for the treatment of CD [5, 6]. In the
acute phase of the disease, parasitological cure rates
range from 40 to 76% [7, 8], and in the chronic phase,
from zero to 30% [9–11]. The variability in the reported
cure rates may be related to the genetic diversity of T.
cruzi, whose strains are referred to as discrete typing
units (DTUs), from TcI to TcVI [12]. The T. cruzi DTUs
may present distinct biological properties, including drug
resistance, in addition to different geographical distribu-
tions [13, 14]. Patients with established Chagas cardio-
myopathy (2854) and treated with BZ presented a
significant reduction in serum parasites without signifi-
cant reduction in the cardiac clinical deterioration after
5 y of follow-up [15]. Furthermore, azole derivatives, in-
cluding posaconazole, although demonstrating promis-
ing results for the experimental infection, had no
efficacy in the human infection [16, 17].
The new epidemiological scenario of CD, in which in-
gestion is the most frequent form of T. cruzi infection,
associated with the unsatisfactory therapeutic response
of the conventional CD drugs, have further incited the
search for alternative treatment approaches against this
disease. Natural products are promising candidates due
to the diversity of their molecular structures and the
ease/reduced cost of obtaining them. Essential oils
(EOs), in particular, have gained attention, as they are
complex mixtures of secondary metabolites, which can
be obtained from various plants worldwide where Cha-
gas is endemic. Several EOs, or their constituents, have
inhibitory activity against protozoa [18, 19], including
in vitro and in vivo trypanocidal action [20, 21]. Re-
cently, the EO of Ferula galbaniflua has been shown to
be effective against promastigote forms of the trypanoso-
matid Leishmania (L.) amazonensis with low cytotoxic
activity against mammalian cells, highlighting the EOs as
strong candidates for future studies of EO activity
against this group of pathogenic parasites [19]. The EO
of Ocimum gratissimum as well as its main constituent,
eugenol, have also demonstrated leishmanicidal activity
on L. amazonensis exposed to the half maximal inhibi-
tory concentration (IC50) for promastigotes and for
amastigotes, causing the parasites to undergo consider-
able ultrastructural alterations [22]. Again, there were no
cytotoxic effects of this EO on mammalian cells, suggest-
ing that it could be used as a source for new antileish-
manial drugs [22].
The biological activities of natural compounds are re-
lated to their constituents, which, in the case of EOs, are
mainly terpenes and terpenoids. The EOs of ginger, Zin-
giber officinale, and of clove, Syzygium aromaticum as
well as its main component, eugenol, have demonstrated
in vitro activity against epimastigotes and trypomasti-
gotes of T. cruzi [20, 23, 24]. Treatment with these EOs
and eugenol inhibited parasite growth, with the EO of S.
aromaticum being the most effective (IC50 = 99.5 μg/mL
for epimastigotes and 57.5 μg/mL for trypomastigotes),
promoting ultrastructural alterations mainly in the nu-
cleus [20]. In another study, eight different EOs were
tested against T. cruzi in vitro, the EO of Cinnamomum
verum was found to be the most effective against the
epimastigote, trypomastigote and amastigote forms of
this parasite, and interfered with the parasite differenti-
ation process. Thus, EOs also represent strong candi-
dates for future studies in order to improve their
activities in pathogenic trypanosomatids [25].
Our group has demonstrated that the oral infection of
mice with different strains of T. cruzi (TcI, TcII and
TcIV) is more severe than the infection by the intraperi-
toneal route using the same inoculation dose [26, 27],

[unpublished data]. Despite the promising results ob-
tained in vitro, studies on the in vivo trypanocidal action
of EOs are scarce and a literature review shows that only
two publications by our group have evaluated these
compounds in mice infected with T. cruzi. The EOs of S.
aromaticum and of Z. officinale, administered alone,
have previously presented anti-T cruzi activity greater
than that of BZ in mice orally inoculated with metacyclic
trypomastigotes obtained from a culture of Y strain
(TcII) [21]. The treatment using the combination of BZ
and S. aromaticum EO in mice orally inoculated with
metacyclic trypomastigotes of the AM14 strain (TcIV)
obtained from the insect vector, also promoted benefits
for the treated animals [28]. Together, these results jus-
tify the continuation of studies regarding EOs, alone or
in combination, using trypomastigotes of different ori-
gins (blood, insect or culture) and other strains of T.
cruzi in the infection of the animals. Thus, the aim of
this study was to evaluate the effects of the essential oils
of S. aromaticum and Z. officinale, administered alone
or in combination with BZ, during the acute phase of in-
fection in mice orally inoculated with blood trypomasti-
gotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi II.
Methods
Ethical aspects
The use, maintenance and care of the experimental ani-
mals were carried out in accordance with the guidelines
of the National Council for the Control of Animal Ex-
perimentation (CONCEA). The animals were obtained
from the Central Vivarium of the State University of
Maringá (UEM) and were maintained in polyethylene
cages in climatized shelves (Alesco, dimensions of 20 ×
32 × 21 cm), with water and feed ad libitum under a
light/dark cycle (12/12 h). This study was approved by
the Committee of Ethics in the Use of Animals in Ex-
perimentation of UEM (CEUA/UEM protocol number
9659251017). At the end of the experiments, the animals
were euthanized by deepening anesthetic with thiopental
(20.0 to 40.0 mg/kg) associated with lidocaine (1.0 to 2.0
mg/kg) intraperitoneally, according to the CONCEA
guidelines.
Inoculation of the animals
Male Swiss Mus musculus mice aged between 21 to 28
days, and with weights between 18 and 22 g, were used.
The animals were fasted for 12 h before being inoculated
by gavage, according to Dias [26], with an inoculum of
10,000 blood trypomastigotes (BT) of the Y strain of T.
cruzi II (TcII). This strain was considered resistant to
BZ (0.0 to 12.5% cure) when orally inoculated in the
mouse, as previously tested [21], and was obtained from
the strain bank in the Laboratory of Chagas Disease
(LDCh) at UEM.
Experimental groups
Two experiments were carried out following the same
protocol, with the difference being the EO used for the
treatment. The animals were divided into 4 groups with
15 animals in each group in the first experiment with S.
aromaticum EO and with 12 animals per group in the
second experiment with Z. officinale EO.
The animals were divided into the four experimen-
tal groups, 3 days after inoculation (DAI). according
to the weight, to ensure there were no significant dif-
ferences between the mean weight of the groups. The
groups were as follows: 1) Untreated control (NT); 2)
Treated with BZ; 3) Treated with EO; and 4) Treated
with BZ + EO. The treatments consisted of oral ad-
ministration of combination 100 mg/kg/day of each,
from the 5th day after inoculation, for 20 consecutive
days, in the morning. In a previous publication by
our team, the dose of 100 mg/kg/day for EOs was
more effective and less toxic than the dose of 250
mg/kg/day [21]. The same BZ manufactured by the
Pharmaceutical Laboratory of the State of Pernam-
buco (Lafepe) was used as the reference drug as well
as in associations with EOs.
Essential oils (EOs)
EOs of ginger (Z. officinale, lot 09419) and clove (S. aro-
maticum, lot 09464) commercially obtained (Quinari
Fragrances and Cosmetics LTDA, Brazil), were used ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed
using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(GC-MS, Shimadzu QP 2000). Clove EO (CEO) was ana-
lyzed on HP-5 column 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm, with
injector temperature of 220 °C, detector temperature of
220 °C, column temperature varying from 50 to 200 °C
at 3 °C/min and injected volume of 1 μL (concentration
of 1% in chloroform). Ginger EO (GEO) was analyzed
on HP-5 column 30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm, with in-
jector temperature of 250 °C, detector temperature of
250 °C, column temperature varying from 70 to 240 °C
at 3 °C/min and injected volume of 1 μL (concentration
of 1% in chloroform).
Infectivity and survival rates
The infectivity rate was obtained by the percentage of
inoculated animals that had at least one positive result
in the tests performed: fresh blood examination (FBE),
blood culture (BC), conventional (cPCR) and real time
(qPCR) polymerase chain reaction. The analysis of sur-
vival of the animals in the different experimental groups
was performed daily throughout the experiment in order
to plot the Kaplan-Meier curve and obtain the cumula-
tive mortality rate (%MORT).

Evaluation of treatment efficacy
One week after the end of treatment, animals of all ex-
perimental groups were submitted to immunosuppres-
sion with cyclophosphamide (Cy) (Genuxal, Baxter) at
50 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally over 4 consecu-
tive days in the first week, and for 3 consecutive days in
the following two weeks [29]. The animals were submit-
ted to FBE and BC tests before and after immunosup-
pression, and cPCR and qPCR after immunosuppression.
A double-blind approach was carried out and the sam-
ples were identified only at the end of the evaluations.
Fresh blood examination (FBE)
Parasitemia was evaluated daily in 5 μL of blood col-
lected from the tail vein of the animal from the 3rd day
after inoculation, according to Brener [30], until negative
for three consecutive days. The following parameters de-
rived from the mean parasitemia curve were evaluated:
pre-patent period (PPP), the calculated mean from the
first day in which positive parasitemia was detected in
each mouse; patent period (PP), the mean of the days in
which each mouse presented positive parasitemia in the
FBE; maximum peak of parasitemia (Pmax), the mean
number of BT in 0.1 mL of blood, calculated from the
Pmax detected for each mouse; day of maximum peak
(Dpmax), the mean of the days in which each mouse
had the highest concentration of parasites in the blood.
Blood culture (BC)
BC was performed on days 3 and 30 after the end of the
treatments, according to Filardi and Brener [31], using
samples of blood collected from the retro-orbital venous
plexus and inoculated in liver infusion and tryptose
(LIT) medium. With the results of this technique, the
percentage of animals with positive blood culture (% +
BC) was obtained.
Conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR)
The blood samples analyzed by cPCR were collected on
day 5 before treatments, to prove the infection of ani-
mals with subpatent parasitemia, and also 30 days after
the end of treatment to monitor the cure. Two hundred
microlitres of blood was added to an eppendorf tube
containing 400 μL of a 6.0 M guanidine and 0.2 M EDTA
solution, according to Miyamoto [32]. Primers #121 (5′-
AAATAATGTACGGG [T/G]GAGATGCATGA-3′) and
#122
(5′-GGTTCGATTGGGGTTGGTGTAATATA-
3′), which amplify the 330 base pair (bp) fragment of the
mini-circle of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) of T. cruzi were
used. After electrophoresis in a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel
and staining with silver, the samples that presented this
fragment were considered positive. With these results,
the percentage of mice that were cPCR positive (% +
cPCR) was obtained.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
The qPCR method was performed both to detect DNA
and to quantify the parasitic blood load. DNA was ex-
tracted with phenol/chloroform according to Caldas
[33], modified by Gruendling [34]. The DNA from the
200 μL blood blood samples and from culture parasites
were quantified with a NanoDrop™ 2000/2000c Spectro-
photometer. The reaction was performed using the
QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) with 100 ng
of total genomic DNA for each sample, and the primers
TCZ-F (5 = −GCTCTTGCCCACAMGGGTGC-3 =) and
TCZ-R
(5 = −CCAAGCAGCGGATAGTTCAGG-3
=)
[35]. The samples were amplified in a LightCycler® 480
under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for
2 min, 35 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and
60 °C for 10 s. At the end of each assay, the melt curve
analysis was performed from 65 to 97 °C in order to
monitor primer dimers or formation of non-specific
products. A standard curve was established using puri-
fied T. cruzi DNA from culture parasites; serial dilutions
ranging from 0.001 to 100 ng of DNA were introduced
into the wells of the reaction plate in triplicate. Based on
these DNA concentrations, the LightCycler®96 software
generated a standard curve that was used to calculate
the parasite DNA concentraton in each sample [35]. The
ratio of parasite/DNA amount (parasite equivalents, par.
eq.) per mL of blood were based on the amount of DNA
per epimastigote cell, in which 200 fg/parasite was con-
sidered [36]. With these results, the percentage of mice
with positive qPCR (% + qPCR) and the mean of parasite
load (PL) in par. eq./mL for each experimental group
were obtained.
Cure criteria
In order to evaluate the efficacy of the different treat-
ments, an animal that presented negative results for all
tests (FBE, BC, cPCR and qPCR) before and after im-
munosuppression with Cy, was considered cured [21,
28]. An animal that presented a positive result in any of
these tests was considered as therapeutic failure.
Statistical analysis
The data were distributed in frequency tables and de-
scribed in terms of percentages or means. Statistical ana-
lyses were performed using the Bioestat 5.0 software
(Belém, Pará, Brazil), with a significance level of 5%. The
proportions were compared using the chi-square test
and the means were compared using the Mann-Whitney
or Kruskall-Wallis tests.
Results
Analysis using GC-MS identified the main constituents
of the two EOs. The EO of S. aromaticum had 82.4% of
eugenol and 12.6% of β-caryophyllene, while the EO of

Z. officinale presented 17.9% of α-pinene, 14.9% of β-
pinene
and
14.7%
of
zingiberene
as
the
major
constituents.
Infectivity and survival rates
The infectivity of the Y strain of T. cruzi with an oral in-
oculum of 10,000 BT/animal was 100% for all groups of
both experiments (Tables 1 and 2). The %MORT in Ex-
periment 1 (CEO) were 42.9, 0.0, 66.7 and 0.0% for the
NT, BZ, CEO and BZ + EO groups, respectively, with no
statistical difference among them. In Experiment 2
(GEO), the %MORT were 75.0% (NT), 8.3% (BZ), 41.7%
(GEO) and 0.0% (BZ + EO), varying significantly (p =
0.02) (Tables 1 and 2). In both experiments, the groups
treated with BZ, alone or in combination, had %MORT
rates close to zero. The survival rates of the animals in
the different groups of both experiments are presented
in Fig. 1.
Mean parasitemia curves
The mean parasitemia curves of the animals in the NT
group, and groups treated with BZ alone, EO alone and
the BZ + EO combination, for the experiment with the S.
aromaticum EO (CEO), are shown in Fig. 2a. It can be
observed that the treatment with CEO alone had no ef-
fect on the parasitemia, with the CEO-treated animals
presenting a parasitemia profile similar to that of the NT
animals. In addition to this, the Pmax of the CEO-
treated animals was around the 16th DAI while for the
NT animals the Pmax was on the 14th DAI, whereby the
number of BT was greater than 60,000 in 0.1 mL of
blood, for both these groups. On the other hand, the an-
imals treated with BZ alone or in combination with
CEO exhibited total suppression of parasitemia through-
out the course of treatment.
The mean parasitemia curves for the experiment with
the EO of Z. officinale (GEO) are shown in Fig. 2b. In
this experiment, the NT animals had a Pmax of about
150,000 BT in 0.1 mL of blood around the 14th DAI,
whereas in animals treated with GEO alone, the Pmax
had a 50% decrease in parasitemia (~ 75,000 BT/0.1 mL
of blood), occurring around the 12th DAI. The groups
treated with BZ, alone and in combination, presented
complete suppression of parasitemia in most animals.
The mean and standard error of PPP varied from
7.6 ± 0.5 days to 11.1 ± 1.5 days for the NT animals in
the two experiments with the Z. officinale and S. aroma-
ticum EOs, respectively (data not shown in the tables).
The effect of the treatments on parasitemia levels, de-
scribed earlier, was confirmed by the other parameters
derived from the parasitemia curve (PP, Pmax and
Dpmax). The values of these parameters presented a sig-
nificant decrease (p < 0.0001) compared with the NT an-
imals, when the four groups were compared at the same
time, for both the experiments with S. aromaticum and
with Z. officinale, independently (Tables 1 and 2). These
values were zero (0.0) in the animals of Experiment 1
treated with BZ alone or in combination with CEO
(Table 1), but not in Experiment 2. In the two-by-two
comparison, it was observed that treatments with both
CEO and GEO alone did not significantly alter the
values of these three parameters.
Other parasitological and molecular parameters
In the experiment with the S. aromaticum EO, the treat-
ments promoted a significant decrease in the % + FBE
(p < 0.001) and % + BC (p < 0.05), with all groups of
treated animals presenting null values, except the group
treated with CEO alone for the % + FBE parameter
(Fig. 3). In the experiment with the Z. officinale EO,
there was also a significant decrease in the % + FBE (p <
0.01), with the results of the groups in increasing order
as
follows:
BZ + EO
(8.3%) < BZ
(25.0%) < GEO
(100.0%) = NT (100.0%). For the % + BC (p < 0.05), the
increasing order was as follows: BZ + EO (0.0%) < BZ
(20.0%) < GEO (42.9%) < NT (100.0%) (Fig. 4).
For the molecular parameters (% + cPCR, % + qPCR
and PL), of the animals in Experiment 1 (CEO), a signifi-
cant decrease (p < 0.0001) was observed only in PL, the
order of which was BZ < BZ + EO < CEO < NT (Figs. 3

and 5a). In Experiment 2 (GEO), besides PL (p < 0.001),
a significant decrease (p < 0.05) was also observed in the
% + cPCR (Figs. 4 and 5b).
The analysis of the qPCR results demonstrated thera-
peutic failure for all treatments, since this technique was
able to detect values as low as 200 fg of DNA in all
treated animals of both experiments (Figs. 3 and 4).
Therefore, all of the animals were considered uncured
(0.0% cure) (Tables 1 and 2).
In short, excluding the parameters of %INF and cure
rate, for which no significant differences were recorded
between the four experimental groups (NT, BZ, EO and
BZ + EO), treatments with BZ (mean of two experi-
ments) alone, CEO alone, GEO alone, BZ + CEO and
BZ + GEO, promoted a significant reduction in 7, 2, 3, 6
and 8 of the 9 parameters analyzed (PP, Pmax, Dpmax,
% + FBE,
% + BC,
% + cPCR,
% + qPCR,
PL
and
%MORT), respectively. When considering the treat-
ments with the EOs alone, we observe that both the
CEO and the GEO promoted a decrease in the BC posi-
tivity rate (p < 0.05) and parasite load (p < 0.01), but only
the GEO alone caused a reduction in the mortality rate
(p < 0.05). However, the treatment with the BZ + GEO
combination resulted in the greatest number of signifi-
cant reductions of these parameters (8/9).
Discussion
The essential oils of S. aromaticum and Z. officinale, ad-
ministered alone and in combination with benznidazole,
in mice orally inoculated with T. cruzi, promoted signifi-
cant decreases in the parasitological and molecular pa-
rameters analyzed. In the experiments with the EO of S.
aromaticum, a significant decrease in the values of 2/9
(CEO alone) and 6/9 (BZ + CEO) parameters was re-
corded, and in the experiments with the EO of Z. offici-
nale there was reduction in 3/9 (alone) and 8/9 (BZ +
GEO) parameters. The EO of Z. officinale alone pro-
moted a greater reduction of parasite load, even when
compared with the reference drug (BZ), which could im-
prove the outcome of T. cruzi infection. However, the
observed reduction in the parameters evaluated was not
sufficient to establish parasitological cure in the acute
phase of animals orally inoculated with BT forms of the

Y strain of T. cruzi II, as evidenced mainly by detection
of parasite DNA using the qPCR technique.
The S. aromaticum essential oil (CEO) had previously
been found to be the most effective against T. cruzi Y
strain in vitro compared to other three essential oils, inhi-
biting parasite growth (IC50 = 99.5 μg/mL for epimasti-
gotes and 57.5 μg/mL for trypomastigotes) [20]. However,
CEO alone was not as effective in the pre-clinical animal
trials as in vitro trial. The ineffectiveness of the treatments
in vivo (0% cure), both with the reference drug, BZ, and
with the Z. officinale essential oil (GEO), administered
alone, corroborate the low cure rates previously obtained
with the same strain (Y - TcII), but with inoculum of
trypomastigotes from different origin (culture-derived),
ranging from 0.0% (BZ) to 22.2% (GEO) [21]. Further-
more, the low cure rate obtained with CEO in this investi-
gation corroborates those obtained from the treatment of
mice inoculated with a different strain (AM14 - TcIV),
ranging from 12.5% (CEO) to 25% (BZ) [28]. However, a
statistically higher cure rate of 44.4%, compared to 0% ob-
tained with BZ, was obtained in a previous study in which
CEO was administered alone in mice inoculated with Y
strain [21]. The difference observed between the cure rates
of these two studies may be related to the infective form
used in the inoculation of the animals. The mice in the
present study were inoculated with 1 × 104 blood trypo-
mastigotes, while those of the study by Zanusso Jr. et al.
[21] used 1 × 106 culture-derived metacyclic trypomasti-
gotes, inoculated by oral gavage.
In the statistical comparisons of the four groups at the
same time for each experiment, it was observed that all
parameters evaluated presented a significant reduction
due to the treatments used, except for % + qPCR. How-
ever, the animals treated with the EO of Z. officinale alone,
although they presented patent parasitemia during the
course of treatment, they had a significantly lower parasite
load (p < 0.01) than the animals of the other groups.
The molecular analysis in this study demonstrated that
qPCR has high sensitivity in the detection of T. cruzi II
DNA, even surpassing cPCR, and evidences therapeutic
failure in animals that had presented negative results by
the other methods (BC and cPCR). The detection of

amounts as low as one parasite equivalent in 100 ng of
DNA allowed the detection of therapeutic failure in the
animals considered cured by other tests. These data
show that the qPCR technique, in addition to quantify-
ing parasite load, is a powerful tool for the detection of
T. cruzi DNA, both in the diagnosis and in the
monitoring of cure after etiological treatment of CD.
The results of qPCR in mice infected with a TcII strain
in this study confirm the findings of Teston et al. [27],
who described the greater sensitivity of qPCR over cPCR
in mice orally inoculated with four strains belonging to
another T. cruzi DTU (TcIV).

In the present study, 1 × 104 BT forms were used for the
oral inoculation of animals; the parasitemia levels of the un-
treated animals were 40X higher than those observed in
mice inoculated by the same route and with the same
strain, but using a greater inoculum of 2 × 106 metacyclic
trypomastigotes derived from culture in LIT medium [21].
In addition, in the animals of the current study, the parasite
load observed in blood was about 6X higher than that ob-
served in cardiac tissue reported by Zanusso et al. [21] and
mortality was 50X higher than the said study. Dias et al.
[26], who also used BT of the Y strain for oral inoculation
of mice, observed similar results to those of our study, in
terms of levels of parasitemia and mortality. These data
suggest that the origin of the trypomastigotes used in the
inoculation interferes in the evolution of the infection.
Mice orally inoculated with the Y strain did not re-
spond to BZ treatment. The cure rates for all treated
groups in the two experiments were 0.0%. This result
demonstrates that the reference drug is not effective in
the experimental treatment of animals orally infected
with T. cruzi. The cure rates presented here are in con-
trast to those observed in other studies with BZ and that
did not use the qPCR, which reported an average of 50%
cure in the animals inoculated with the same strain, but
via the intraperitoneal route (IP). This fact suggests that
the Y strain is partially resistant to BZ when intraperito-
neally inoculated [7, 31, 37], and resistant to this drug
when orally inoculated [21]. In addition to the evidence
of a greater severity of CD when orally acquired [27, 38,
39], our data suggest a worse response to the etiological
treatment in the oral infection. As perspectives of this
study, further analyzes are required in order to evaluate
the toxicity of the essential oils in vivo, the efficacy of
their major constituents separately, such as eugenol, the
main constituent of the S. aromaticum EO, and also to
evaluate the efficacy of these and of other EOs against
the genetic diversity (other DTUs) of T. cruzi.
Conclusions
The treatments with BZ and the EOs reduced the parasite
load and avoided lethality of the infection in the treated
animals, except in the case of CEO alone. Treatment with
GEO proved to be promising against T. cruzi infection,
demonstrating cPCR negativity in all of animals when as-
sociated with BZ. Moreover, the isolated use of this EO
promoted a greater reduction in the parasite load com-
pared with the other groups, including those treated with
BZ, in addition to an increased survival rate. The results
also reveal that the Y strain of T. cruzi, when orally inocu-
lated in mice, is resistant to the reference drug, BZ. Fi-
nally, the high sensitivity of qPCR was confirmed, since it
was able to detect T. cruzi DNA in treated animals that
would be considered cured by other techniques.
