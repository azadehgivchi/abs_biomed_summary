Background
Urinary stone and urinary tract infections (UTI) are constantly
associated complaints of the urinary system [1].
Urinary stones also known as urolithiasis [2] are hard
masses produced in the urinary tract and cause infection,
pain, bleeding or obstruction. Multiple types of stones
such as oxalate, uric acid, cysteine, or struvite stone can
be produced in the urinary tract [3]. Infection stones
include magnesium ammonium phosphate or struvite
(which accounts to 10–15% of urinary stone), carbonate
apatite and ammonium urate. Urease producing bacteria
such as Proteus are responsible for production of urease
enzyme which alkalinizes urine and produce these stones
[4, 5]. Moreover, ammonia and oxalate stones damage the
urothelial layer facilitating microbial invasion [6].
E. coli, a urease negative bacterium is the most common
cause of UTI and dominant isolate in urinary stones
and urine cultures. Its existence in stone indicates either
urease negative bacteria have a role in stone formation
or urease producing bacteria transiently infect and lost
after stone formation [7]. Urease producing bacteria
include Proteus, Morganella, Pseudomonas, Providencia,
Klebsiella and S. aureus and are common causes of UTI
[8]. P. mirabilis is the prominent urease producing species
and cause of struvite calculi [9]. Bacteria incrusted in
or attached on the surface of stone forming biofilm and
cause recurrent and multidrug resistant (MDR) UTI [10].
The rate of UTI among urolithiasis patients ranges from
7 to 60% [11] with the coincidence of these comorbidities
results in complications such as renal failure and death
[12].
Urinary stone disease is one of the worldwide threats
which has been increasing particularly in the last 15 years
[13, 14]. Factors such as sex, previous history of UTI,
condom use, vaginal infection, extremes of age, anatomical
abnormalities like congenital urinary tract malformations,
urinary obstruction, catheterization, resent sexual
activity, comorbidities like urinary stone, diabetes and
obesity [8, 15, 16], hospitalization, antibiotic use are risks
factors to UTI [17]. Information about the burden of UTI
among patients with urinary calculi is lacking in Ethiopia.
This study is aimed to investigate bacterial uropathogens,
antimicrobial resistance and associated factors among
Urinary stone patients at the University of Gondar Comprehensive
Specialized Hospital, Gondar Ethiopia.
Materials and methods
Study area, design, and period
A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from
January to April, 2019, at the University of Gondar Comprehensive
Specialized Hospital. The hospital is located
in Gondar town, Amhara regional state, Northwest Ethiopia,
situated at 742 km from the capital city of Ethiopia,
Addis Ababa. The hospital is a tertiary level teaching and
referral hospital catering more than 500 beds for inpatients
and rendering referral health services for over 5
million inhabitants in Northwest Ethiopia.
Population All patients who have visited the hospital
during the study period and clinically suspected of urinary
stone disease were the source population while
patients with ultrasound confirmed urinary stone were
study population. All the study participants were enrolled
from the outpatient department.
Exclusion criteria Patients with history of antibiotic use
in the last 2 weeks prior to diagnosis and during the data
collection period were excluded or denied from the study
because those who have been taking antibiotics may have
culture negative due to their resent drug use. All patients
who had urinary system complains, were confirmed to
have urinary stone with ultrasound and not on antibiotics
treatment in the last 2 weeks as well as during the
study period and willing to be included were eligible to
this study.
Sample size and sampling methods
The sample size was calculated by a single population
proportion formula taking 50% prevalence since previous
study involving urinary stone patients was not available.
Using reduction formula as the total population based
on the same period of the last year’s record, estimated
population was 1350, the final sample size was
where N is the total population, nf—
the final sample
size, Zα/
2—the standard normal deviation, at 95% confidence
level = 1.96, p—The prevalence = 0.5; 1 − p = 0.5
and d—The desired degree of accuracy = 0.05.
Data collection and laboratory methods
A total of 300 study participants with urinary stone were
enrolled in the study using convenient sampling technique.
Sociodemographic and clinical features of study
participants such as age, gender, residence, history of
UTI and drug use, stone size and its position, presence
of stone at multiple sites, condom use, catheterization
and presence of comorbidites like history of diabetes,
HIV were colleceted using structured questionaire. Clean
catch mid-stream urine was collected in a sterile wide
mouthed urine cup with prior adiquate instruction of the
participant (Additional file 1).
Culture and microbiological identification
Early morning mid-stream urine sample was collected
and transported to medical bacteriology laboratory; inoculated
in Cysteine lactose electrolyte deficient (CLED)
agar (
BIOMARKR Laboratories, India) within two hours
and incubated for 18–24 h at 35–37 °C. A 0.001 mL inoculating
loop was used to inoculate the urine specimen.
Colonies with significant bacteriuria (≥ 105 CFU/mL)
were subcultured on blood agar plate (BAP) and Mac-
Conkey agar for isolation of a single species and further
characterization by hemolysis on BAP, lactose fermentation
on MacConkey agar. Gram staining and biochemical
tests such TSI, motility test, indole test, citrate test, urease
test, Lysine decarboxylase, catalase, coagulase tests,
novobiocin sensitivity, and Bile Esculin (
BIOMARKR
Laboratories, India) hydrolysis test were used for species
identification [18].
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed
using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method on
Muller-Hinton agar (
BIOMARKR Laboratories, India).
Selected antimicrobial agents such as Ampicillin (10 μg),
Amoxicillin-clavulanate (20/10 μg), Ciprofloxacin (5 μg),
Tobramycin (10 μg), Gentamicin (10 μg), Cefixime (5 μg),
Cefoxitin (30 μg), Cefuroxime (30 μg), Nitrofurantoin
(300 μg), Rifampin (5 μg), Tetracycline (30 μg), Penicillin
10 units, Norfloxacin (10 μg), Vancomycin (30 μg),
Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxzole (1.25/23.75 μg) (Abtek
Biologicals Ltd, United Kingdom) and Cefotaxime
(30 μg), Ceftazidime (30 μg), Cefotaxime-Clavulanate
(30/10 μg), Ceftazidime-Clavulanate (30/10 μg) (HiMedia
Laboratories Pvt Ltd India) were used for antimicrobial
susceptibility test [19]. Zones of inhibition were
measured after 16–18 h of incubation at 37 °C and classified
as susceptible or resistant. Isolates intermediate
between susceptible and resistant were considered as
resistant [20]. Isolates resistant to three or more classes
of antibiotics were considered as MDR [21].
Extended spectrum beta lactamase detection
First screening for ESBL production was done for Cefotaxime
and Ceftazidime 30 μg each. Isolates with zone
of inhibition ≤ 27 mm for cefotaxime and ≤ 22 mm
for ceftazidime were phenotypically confirmed for
ESBL production by using Ceftazidime-clavulanic acid
(30 μg/10 μg), Cefotaxime-clavulanic acid (30 μg/10 μg)
with their respective single disks using combined disk
test. The suspension of screened isolates was prepared
and inoculated on MHA. The target antibiotics were then
placed at least 25 mm apart from each other followed by
16–18 h of incubation at 35 °C ± 2 °C and zone of inhibition
was measured. At least 5 mm difference to either of
the combined drugs and their respective single disks was
considered as ESBL producing species [19].
Quality control The questionnaire was pretested for
standardization and clearity. The culture media were
checked for sterility and performance prior to inoculation
by incubating 5% of the newly prepared media overnight.
The reagents for Gram’s stain were also assured
for their expiry date and staining. The control strains E.
coli ATCC25922 and S. aureus ATCC25923 were used
to control performance of media and antibiotic disks.
Furthermore, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and E. coli
ATCC25922 were used as a positive and negative control
for ESBL production respectively. The suspension was
standardized against 0.5 McFarland standards [19].
Data processing and analysis Data were entered and
analyzed using SPSS version 23 software. Discriptive
statistics such as frequency and percentage were determined.
The binary mogistic regression model was used.
The assumption Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit as
well as cox and snell and Nagelkerke R squire valus were
checked and the model was fit. Bivariate and multivariate
logistic regression analysis were carried out with enter
method to determine statistically significant association
and odds ratio at 95% confidence interval was computed.
Variables with a P value < 0.2 in bivariate logistic regression
analysis were entered to multivariate logestic regression
analysis [22, 23]. Variables with P value < 0.05 in
multivariate logistic regression analysis were considered
as statistically significant.
Result
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients
with urinary stone
Of the 300 urinary stone patients enrolled in the present
study, 153(51%) were male, 123(41%) were in age
group 20–29 years, 261(87%) were urban dwellers and
134(44.7%) were patients with educational level of college
and above. More than half, 176(58.7%) of participants
had family monthly income 2000 Ethiopian birr
and above (Table 1). Thirty-three (11%) of study participants
had history of UTI, 25(8.3%) of them had stone size
of 5 mm and above. Nine (3%) of the participants had
history of urinary blockage and 166(55.3%) of them had
history of antibiotic use while 17(5.7%) were hospitalized
previously (Table 2).
The prevalence of bacterial uropathogens among patients
with urinary stone
Forty-nine 49/300(16.3%) (95% CI 12–21%) of the urinary
stone patients had UTI. The most common cause of
UTI was E. coli 14/49(28.6%) followed by S. saprophyticus
and Enterococcus species 8/49(16.3%) each, K. pneumoniae
and S. aureus 7/49(14.3%) each (Fig. 1).
Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial uropathogens
among patients with urinary stone
Majority of Gram-negative isolates were resistant to
ampicillin 25/26 (96.2%), amoxicillin-clavulanate 18/26
(69.2%) while 46/49 (94%) and 44/49(90%) of the Gramnegative
isolates were susceptible to nitrofurantoin and
ciprofloxacin respectively. All S. saprophyticus 8(100%)
and 6/7 (85.7%) of S. aureus were susceptible to gentamycin.
Two 2/8(25%) S. saprophyticus and 1/7 (14.3%)
of S. aureus isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (surrogate
marker for methicillin resistance), and one vancomycin
resistant Enterococcus was isolated (Table 3).
MDR and ESBL producing uropathogenic isolates
among patients with urinary stone
Of the total uropathogens, 16/49(32.7%) were MDR and
75% of which were Enterobacteriaceae. The most common
MDR species were E. coli 7/49(14.3%), followed by
K. pneumoniae 3/49(6.12%). Furthermore, from a total
of 26 Enterobacteriaceae 9/26(34.6%) isolates were confirmed
ESBL producing species. These confirmed ESBL
producing isolates were E. coli 6/26 (23.1%) and K. pneumoniae
3/26(11.5%) (Table 4).
Factors associated with urinary tract infection
among patients with urinary stone
Among the variables, sex, age, education, monthly
income, history of UTI, blockage of urinary system,
stone size, stone location in the urinary system, history
of chronic disease and drug use, sexual activity, history
of hospitalization, and body mass index had P value < 0.2
in bivariate analysis and were computed by multivariate
logistic regression analysis to check statistically significant
association by controlling possible confounders.
The result of multivariate logistic regression showed that
being female, history of UTI, drug use had a P value of
< 0.05; which indicates statistically significant association
with patients having urinary stone diseases (Table 5).
Discussion
The overall prevalence of UTI among patients with urinary
stone was 49/300 (16.3%) (95% CI 12–21%). This
result is similar to reports by Gutierrez et al. 16.2%
[24] and lower than a study done in china 22.0% [25],
Iran 35.5% [26], Romania 25.8% [27] and India 45%
[11] among urinary stone patients. However, this result
was higher than 7.8% prevalence of UTI reported from
Los Angeles, United States [28]. The variation might be
because of the socioeconomic, geographical and population
difference. The predominant species isolated in
this study were E. coli, 14/49(28.6%) followed by S. saprophyticus
and Enterococcus species 8/49 (16.3%) each.
The result was comparable to other reports 33% E.coli
and 18.5% Enterococci isolated from patients with urinary
stone [29]. On the other hand the result was higher than
6.5% prevalence of E.coli reported by Gutierrez et al. [24].
The resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, amoxicillin-
clavulanate and Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxzole
in this study was 31/33(94%), 18/26(69.23%) and
17(41.5%) respectively which was slightly lower than
a report in India ampicillin 96% and amoxicillin-clavulanate
87% [30]. The result of this study was higher
than resistance to Ampicillin 70%, and Amoxicillinclavulanic
acid 30% reported in Romania [27]. The
high rate of resistance might be due to easy access and
prescribed
antimicrobial agents, wider availability of empirical
treatment in health care settings [12, 31, 32]. Most of
the isolates identified were susceptible to nitrofurantoin
46/49(94%) and ciprofloxacin 44/49(90%). There were
two methicillin resistant S. saprophyticus and one methicillin
resistant S. aureus (MRSA) which was nearly similar
to a case of methicillin resistant coagulase negative
staphylococcus report in Romania [27].
From a total of 16 MDR isolates, E. coli 7/16(43.75%)
and K. pneumoniae 3/16(18.75%) were the most common
MDR species. The MDR isolates in this study
were higher than 29.3% MDR E. coli, 6.8% K. pneumoniae
but lower compared to 12.0% MDR E. faecalis.
The difference could be due to sample size variation
[33]. Furthermore, 9/26(34.6%) of the total 26 Enterobacteriaceae,
were ESBL producing species. These
ESBL producing species were E. coli 6/26(23%) and K.
pneumoniae 3/26(11.5%) species. This result was lower
than 51.8% of the overall prevalence of ESBL producing
Enterobacteriaceae [12]. The prevalence of ESBL
producing Enterobacteriaceae from the total E.coli isolates
was higher than 8.7% result by Bianca et al. [31].
This might be due to variation in the management and
use of antibiotics.
In the present study the prevalence of UTI was
higher among female participants 36/49 (73.5%). This
corresponds to a study done by Bianca et al. [31] 74.2%
in females and 25.8% in males. The result was slightly
higher than a 67% prevalence in females as compared
to 33% in males [11]. The likelihood of acquiring UTI
in females was 5.76 times higher compared to males
(AOR 5.76, 95% CI 2.23–13.32). This could be due to
the physio-anatomical variations between males and
females including anal and genital proximity, short
urethra as well as sexual activity in females which
ease the access of intestinal flora to the urinary tract
in females. On the other hand antimicrobial activity
of the prostate secretions in males could contribute to
the reduced infection rate among males than female
participants [25, 27].
The finding of this study showed that 15/49(31%) of
patients with significant bacteriuria had previous history
of UTI. Having history of UTI increases the risk of
UTI by 4.7 times (AOR 4.66, 95% CI 1.76–12.30) than
those who had not. This might be due to the release
of bacteria from the inside of stone or from its matrix
protected surface resulting in persistence or recurrence
of the UTI. Previous history of UTI is among
the factors that predisposes to the occurrence of the
infection [15]. The treatment might not have completely
removed the etiologic agent of UTI in patients.
Because the bacteria can be incrusted in the stone or
extracellular matrix and escape from the treatment
[34].
In addition, 36/49(73.5%) patients with significant
bacteriuria had previous history of drug use and
showed a statistically significant association with UTI.
The risk of UTI among patients who had not history of
drug use reduces by 67% compared to those who had
history of drug use (AOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14–0.77). This
could be due to the fact that steroidal drugs are immunosuppressive
and patients could be immunocompromised
[30]. The increased antimicrobial resistance in
drug users and the recurrence or persistence of drug
resistant UTI might also contribute.
As a limitation only urine specimen was taken for
culture and stone culture was not performed to which
could help to know the agreement of stone and urine
culture strain characterization was not performed due
to lack of resources.
Conclusion
The commonest bacterial species isolated from patients
with urinary stone disease was E. coli. The most common
MDR and ESBL producing isolates were E. coli
and K. pneumoniae. Being female, previous history
of UTI and drug use were the independent risk factors.
Isolated uropathogens were most susceptible to
nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin and gentamycin. However,
most of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin,
penicillin and trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole. Routine
diagnosis of urinary stone patients for urinary tract
infection should be promoted. Antimicrobial stewardship
program should be implemented to reduce drug
resistance.
