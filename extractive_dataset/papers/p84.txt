Background
Atrial septal defect (ASD) is clinically common, account-
ing for 20–30% of congenital heart disease cases [1–3].
Conversely, patent foramen ovale (PFO) refers to the
condition in which the foramen ovale does not close
after 3 years of age. Clinical research has confirmed that
PFO is closely related to migraine and abnormal stroke
[4, 5]. With the continuous development of interven-
tional therapeutic devices for congenital heart diseases,
interventional occlusion of secundum ASD/PFO has
been gradually improving. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a
clinically common tachyarrhythmia that can lead to car-
diac insufficiency and thromboembolism [6]. Given that
> 90% of thrombi in patients with AF and non-valvular
heart disease arise from the left atrial appendage (LAA),
transcatheter LAA closure (LAAC) has become an im-
portant approach for preventing the occurrence of
thrombus in such patients. Its clinical benefits and safety
have been reported in many randomized controlled trials
and cohort studies [7–9].
Previous studies have shown that the occurrence rate
of AF in patients with ASD is significantly higher than
that in normal individuals and increases proportionally
with age [10, 11]. The literature indicates that the occur-
rence rates of AF in patients with ASD aged > 40 and > 60
years are approximately 21 and 52%, respectively [12–14].
ASD shunts in the atrium allow blood flow from the left
atrium to the right atrium, causing the blood volumes of
the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery to
increase, thus aggravating the right ventricular volume
overload. The pathological basis of AF in patients with
ASD is enlargement of the right atrium and right ven-
tricle. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) has a
lower success rate and higher recurrence rate for these pa-
tients. At present, the procedure of ASD/PFO occlusion
and LAAC are gradually mature. However, for patients
with ASD/PFO and AF, one-stop occlusion (combination
of ASD/PFO occlusion and LAAC) has not yet been inves-
tigated systematically, and its feasibility is unknown. In
this study, 49 patients with ASD/PFO and AF underwent
one-stop occlusion, and their clinical data were analyzed
to assess the feasibility of the treatment.
Methods
Patient selection
Inpatients with AF and ASD/PFO at the Southwest
Hospital of the Army Medical University were included
between August 2014 and April 2019, based on the
following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion cri-
teria: a. For patients with PFO, they have ischemic
stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA), or a periph-
eral thromboembolic event or a large right-to-left shunt.
For patients with ASD, TTE show clear indications for
ASD occlusion. b. TEE show clear indications for LAAC.
c. Non-valvular AF. d. CHA2DS2VASc score ≥ 2, and
HAS-BLED score ≥ 3 or having a contraindication to
anticoagulant therapy or unwilling to receive long-term
warfarin therapy. e. Patients were willing to accept the
one-stop occlusion. Exclusion criteria: a. Valvular heart
disease. b. Left atrial or LAA thrombosis. c. ASD requir-
ing surgical repair, congenital heart diseases requiring
other thoracotomy treatment. d. Severe heart failure
(New York Heart Association class IV). e. Severe renal
or hepatic insufficiency. f. Acute stroke occured within
1 month.g. Patients were unwilling to accept the one-
stop occlusion. This was a retrospective study. Ethical
approval of this study was obtained from ethics commit-
tee of Southwest Hospital (the approval number was
KY2020171 and the date was March 92,020). All the par-
ticipated patients provided written informed consent.
Devices
The LAAC devices adopted in this study were the
Watchman LAA Closure Device and Access Sheath pro-
duced by American Boston Scientific. ASD occluders
and delivery systems were produced by Shanghai Shape
Memory Alloy Materials Co., Ltd. The PFO occluders
and its transmission system were manufactured by
Beijing Huayi Shengjie Technology Co., Ltd.
Preoperative preparation
The patients were examined preoperatively, including
routine examination of the blood, coagulation function,
hepatorenal function, thyroid function, ECG and pul-
monary function test, TTE, and TEE. The ASD/PFO size
and margin were measured. The LAA morphology was
observed, and the presence of thrombus was determined.
The LAA orifice width and depth were measured at four
angles, 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°, to confirm whether the pa-
tients had LAAC (Fig. 1a and b).
LAAC
Under general anesthesia and TEE monitoring, the pa-
tients underwent LAAC [15]. The right femoral vein was

punctured. Right heart catheterization was performed to
measure the pressure in the pulmonary artery, right ven-
tricle, and right atrium. A catheter was inserted through
the ASD and into the left atrium to measure the pres-
sure. To perform LAA angiography (Fig. 2a), a special
sheathing canal of the LAAC was placed, through which
a pigtail angiographic catheter was directed to the LAA
with the following positions: Right Anterior Oblique
(RAO) 30° + Cranial (CRA) 20° and RAO 30° + Caudal
(CAU) 20° (Fig. 2a). LAA orifice width and depth mea-
surements, in combination with TEE measurement, were
used to select suitable LAA occluders, with the diameter
of the Watchman devices determined to be ≥4-6 mm,
larger than the LAA. The LAA occluders were sent into
the LAA along the sheathing canal for LAA angiography
(Fig. 2b). TEE was used to observe the position of the
occluders and their effects. A pull test was conducted to
judge the stability of the LAA occlude (Fig. 2c). After
confirming suitable positioning of the LAA occluders
and good plugging effect, the occluders were released
(Fig. 1c and d), and the pressure in the left atrium was
measured repeatedly.
ASD/PFO occlusion
ASD/PFO occlusion was performed in accordance with
the routine method used during catheterization [16]. A
special sheathing canal for the ASD/PFO occlusion was
placed in the left atrium. ASD/PFO occluders were sent
along the sheathing canal to plug the ASD/PFO (Fig. 2d).
Under X-ray and TEE guidance, a pull test was per-
formed to observe the stability of the occluders and their
effects (Fig. 2e). After confirming that the occluders
were suitably positioned, they were released (Fig. 2f).
The sheathing canal was withdrawn.
Postoperative treatment
After the operation, patients stayed in the cardiac care unit
for 24-h continuous monitoring of ECG, blood pressure,
and
oxyhemoglobin
saturation.
Low-molecular-weight
heparin was subcutaneously injected after operation. Oral
warfarin or Novel Oral Anticoagulants(NOAC) was admin-
istered at 45–60 days after operation. If the TEE showed
complete closure of the LAA, no device-related thrombus,
the patients were then switched to both aspirin and clopi-
dogrel until 6 months. The INR was maintained at

approximately 2.0–3.0. After 6 months, they began taking
enteric coated aspirin tablets (100 mg) once per day.
Follow-up visit
Patients underwent follow-up visits at 3, 30, 45–60, 90,
180 and 360 days after operation. During the follow-up
visits, the patients reported their subjective symptoms,
and their blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, and TTE were
recorded. During the first 45–60 days of follow-up visit,
TEE was performed. The position of the plug device was
checked for any shifting. The patients were also checked
for remnant shunts and relevant thrombogenesis of de-
vices. Their INR was checked, and their warfarin dosage
was adjusted accordingly. The patients were followed up
again every 6 months.
Statistical analysis
SPSS 13.0 statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)
was used. Continuous data were expressed as mean ±
standard deviation. Analysis of variance and Chi-square
test were adopted to compare the data between the
groups. The counted data were analyzed by using the χ2
test. In all tests, P values < 0.05 were considered statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
In the ASD group, there were 24 patients with ASD and
AF (two patients with double-hole ASD); the average
ASD diameter was 14.5 ± 7.4 mm, and the types of AF
were persistent AF in 21 patients and paroxysmal AF in
3 patients. Five patients are unwilling to receive long-
term warfarin therapy. In the PFO group, there were 25
patients with PFO and AF, including 24 patients with
persistent AF and 1 patient with paroxysmal AF. Six
patients are unwilling to receive long-term warfarin ther-
apy. Table 1 shows the basic data and clinical character-
istics between the two groups.
Interventional therapeutic outcomes
Forty-nine patients successfully completed the one-stop
occlusion. LAAC was performed first, followed by ASD/
PFO occlusion; no operation-related complications oc-
curred. The pressure in each cardiac cavity, LAA size,

occluder size, and effect of occluder usage before one-
stop occlusion in the two groups are shown in Table 2.
A total of 26 ASD occluders were implanted in the 24
patients with ASD and AF (two double-hole ASD occlu-
ders were implanted in two patients), with an average
diameter of 25.4 ± 8.5 mm. Conversely, 25 PFO occlu-
ders (including PF2525 in 22 patients and PF3030 in 3
patients) were implanted in the 25 patients with PFO
and AF. In a patient with a large ASD and persistent AF,
the diameter of ASD is 34 mm and the maximum width
and depth of the LAA were 21 and 23 mm, respectively.
The occlusion device was implanted successfully with
the use of a 27-mm Watchman occluder and 44-mm
ASD occlude (Fig. 3a, b and c). In one patient with
double-hole ASD and persistent AF, the largest diameter
of the LAA was 27 mm, and the largest depth was 31
mm; the occlusion was successful with the use of a 33-
mm Watchman occluder. The diameter of the double-
hole ASD was 11 and 13 mm, respectively; the spacing
was 10.5 mm; and the occlusion was successful with the
use of 22- and 24-mm ASD occluders (Fig. 3d, e and f).
Follow-up visit
All patients were followed up for more than 1 year, with
an average follow-up duration of 29.0 ± 12.1 months.
Twenty-three patients took warfarin (average INR, 2.3 ±

0.2), and 26 patients took NOAC (dabigatran in 20 pa-
tients and rivaroxaban in 6 patients). One case of skin
ecchymosis occurred after warfarin administration. The
INR was 3.5. The ecchymosis disappeared after the war-
farin
dosage
was
adjusted.
After
45–60 days,
TEE
showed that the position of the occluder was normal
and that occluder thrombosis occurred in two patients
(Fig. 1e) (warfarin was used in one and new anticoagu-
lant in the other); the anticoagulant treatment scheme
was then adjusted (the warfarin group switched to re-
ceiving a new anticoagulant and vice versa, and the INR
was maintained at 2.0–3.0). TEE showed that the
thrombus disappeared 6 months after operation (Fig. 1f).
No stroke, TIA, or other thromboembolism occurred in
all patients during the follow-up period.
The influence of one-stop occlusion on cardiac
morphology and structure
All patients completed the TEE examination at 3, 90 and
180 days after operation. Table 3 shows the comparison
of the measurement results of the diameters of left
atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle
and LVEF between the two groups.
In the ASD group, the diameters of the right atrium
and right ventricle decreased at 3, 90 and 180 days after
operation, and the LVEF significantly increased at 90 and
180 days after operation; in the PFO group, the diameters
of the left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, and right
ventricle and LVEF had no significant difference.
Discussion
ASD is a clinically common congenital heart disease,
and AF is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias.
ASD shunts in the atrium allow blood flow from the left
atrium to the right atrium, resulting in increased atrial
size, elevated atrial wall pressure and stretching force,
reconstruction of the anatomical structure of the atrium,
and atrial electrical remodeling. Therefore, patients with
ASD often experience AF complications. Moreover, the
occurrence rate of AF in patients with ASD increases
significantly with age [12]. Mandalenakis [17], a Swedish
doctor, reviewed the follow-up data of 21,982 young pa-
tients with congenital heart disease and compared them

with those of a normal population. During the 42 years
of clinical follow-up, the risk of AF in the patients with
congenital heart disease was 21.99 times higher than that
in the normal population, among which active pulse
narrowing, ASD, and PFO were all high-risk factors.
Although the patients with congenital heart disease were
divided into two groups independently, it was found that
those with congenital heart disease were more likely to
develop stroke when they had heart failure or AF, and
the risk of stroke was six times higher than that in other
patients with congenital heart disease.
Further, AF may still occur in some patients with ASD
after surgical correction or transcatheter closure. Park
[18] found through a follow-up study that transient atrial
flutter or AF, short posterior inferior margin of ASD,
and age greater than 48 years were predictors of new AF
after ASD treatment. Nyboe [19] reported that among
1168 patients who underwent ASD occlusion, the risk of
AF and stroke was higher than that of normal individ-
uals, and there was no significant difference between re-
pair and occlusion, at an average follow-up duration of
9.6 years. Therefore, in cases of ASD with AF, even if
ASD is treated with radical operation (surgical repair or
transcatheter closure), the persistent AF still becomes an
important cause of thromboembolism complications,
which require long-term oral anticoagulant therapy.
With the continuous progress of RFCA techniques for
the treatment of AF guided by CARTO system, there
have been reports about combination of RFCA and ASD
occlusion. However, this therapy is only available for pa-
tients that the duration of AF is short or the atrial en-
largement is not obvious. Moreover, patients with AF
who are treated with RFCA may relapse. Thus, it is not
an ideal therapy.
PFO and AF are important causes of cardiogenic em-
bolism. Although three randomized controlled studies
published in 2012–2013 did not report an effective role
in the prevention of recurrence of stroke of unknown
cause [20–22], that is, PFO blocking is not better than
drug treatment, further analysis shows that the preven-
tion of recurrence of stroke is related to the use of
blocking devices. Amplatzer PFO occluder is reportedly
better than drug therapy in the prevention of stroke re-
currence [23, 24]. In recent years, LAAC has been widely
used in clinical practice as a new technique to prevent
stroke caused by non-valvular AF. A number of random-
ized controlled clinical studies also show that the thera-
peutic effect is better than that of oral anticoagulants. In
particular, the 5-year follow-up results of PREVAIL and
PROTECT-AF showed that the risk of hemorrhagic
stroke was lower than that with warfarin. At present, al-
though there are few reports of ASD/PFO combined
with AF, there is still a lack of systematic research and
long-term follow-up results. This study of 49 adult
patients with ASD/PFO and AF showed that one-stop
occlusion was feasible. However, the treatment requires
detailed attention to selection of indications, technical
execution, postoperative management, and follow-up,
which should be strictly adhered to.
More attention should be given to the following points
when selecting the indications of one-stop occlusion: (1)
the indications should be strictly grasped. Patients with
ASD without interventional occlusion indications or car-
diovascular abnormality warranting thoracotomy opti-
mally should undergo operation and excision of the
LAA. (2) It is very difficult to perform LAAC after ASD
occlusion (it is difficult to puncture the atrial septum);
thus, it is necessary to carefully evaluate whether it is ne-
cessary to perform LAAC before ASD occlusion. At
present, a CHA2DS2VASc score of ≥2 points is required
as a more recognized indication of LAAC. Our study
also strictly followed this standard. However, we also ex-
cluded some patients with ASD and persistent AF dur-
ing recruitment. The CHA2DS2VASc score was less than
2 points, while the left atrium was significantly enlarged;
further, only the atrial defect was occluded, and anti-
coagulant treatment was then performed. At present, we
are continuing to perform follow-up. If patients are will-
ing to receive LAAC, we need to explore whether one-
stop treatment can be performed simultaneously.
The technical execution of one-stop occlusion in pa-
tients with ASD and AF also had detailed specifications.
It was necessary to conduct LAAC first, followed by
ASD occlusion.
We should avoid the displacement of the LAA occlu-
der in the course of ASD occlusion. For patients with
large ASD, the pulmonary vein release method might be
applied for the ASD occlusion, as the patient in the
present study, in whom an ASD size of 34 mm was suc-
cessfully plugged with a 44-mm plug device using the
pulmonary vein release method. The LAA occluders
were not impacted. However, for double ASD patients, it
is necessary to place two occluders. When the applica-
tion of the pulmonary vein release method is inconveni-
ent, more caution must be practiced, as pressure on the
LAA occluders might cause them to disconnect, which
should be avoided. In our double ASD case, two occlu-
ders with diameters of 22 and 24 mm were placed.
Under strict TEE monitoring, the operation was com-
pleted without any complication, indicating that with
strict monitoring and careful operative technique, one-
stop occlusion is safe. In addition, although atrial septum
puncture for LAAC is not necessary for ASD patients
with persistent AF, it appears to be simpler. However,
due to the larger ASD, the sheathing canal of LAA
occluders is easy to sway and challenging to fix. Thus,
on the contrary, it increases the operative difficulty
index. Operators should have sufficient experience to

ensure the stability of the sheathing canal and avoid ser-
ious complications.
After
LAAC,
antithrombotic
therapy
and
device-
related thrombus (DRT) have become some of the clin-
ical issues of concern. Fauchier [25] reviewed the data of
469 patients with AF who received LAAC in eights cen-
ters in France from 2012 to 2017. The incidence rate of
Watchman occluder DRT was 4.8% (13/272), which is
consistent with the rate of 4.1% (2/49) found in our
study. They concluded that the occurrence of DRT after
LAAC was closely related to the selection of postopera-
tive antithrombotic therapy and different blocking de-
vices.
At
present,

LAAC. The previous research of the research group con-
firmed that the three plans of incorporating new anti-
coagulant, warfarin, and dual antiplatelet therapy after
LAAC are feasible [26]. Two or three occluders were im-
planted in patients with ASD/PFO combined with AF
for one-stop occlusion. Based on the previous experience
on structural heart disease occlusion and the scheme
after LAAC, anticoagulation therapy is recommended.
Therefore, we compared the differences between NOAC
and warfarin in two postoperative anticoagulant regi-
mens and concluded that it is feasible to use NOAC or
warfarin after operation for patients with ASD/PFO
combined with AF. In this study, we found that by chan-
ging to other anticoagulants and prolonging the anti-
coagulant time in two patients with DRT, the DRT was
resolved; this further stressed that after one-stop occlu-
sion, the prognosis is generally good, as long as the regu-
lar antithrombotic treatment is maintained, even if DRT
occurs.
Limitations
There are some limitations in our study that need to be
considered. Firstly, because the technology of one-stop
occlusion is difficult, accumulation of extensive experi-
ence is necessary. In addition, the costs of one-stop oc-
clusion are covered by some types of medical insurance,
and others are transferred to patients directly. So some
patients may not be able to afford the costs. Finally, fur-
ther studies are required to determine the long-term
safety and efficacy of this approach.
Conclusion
In summary, suitable indications should be selected, and
strict operative specifications are necessary for the treat-
ment of patients with ASD and AF using one-stop oc-
clusion. Reinforced monitoring and follow-up visits after
operation are also critical. Given these requirements,
one-stop occlusion is safe and effective for the treatment
of adult patients with ASD/PFO and AF. It is also feas-
ible to administer warfarin or NOAC after operation.
