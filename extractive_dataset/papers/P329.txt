Background
According to the most recent estimates of the World
Health Organization (WHO), in 2015 alone malaria
caused 438,000 deaths with estimated 214 million new
cases [1]. Infections with Plasmodium falciparum are responsible
for more than 90% of malaria-related deaths,
particularly in African countries [1]. Drug resistance of P.
falciparum is the greatest challenge in the fight against
malaria, as the parasite has developed resistance to most
of the drugs presently used for the treatment of malaria.
These factors have led to the earnest need to discover new
molecular targets and identify new drug leads against
those targets [2].
Post-translational modifications are necessary for the progression
of P. falciparum life cycle [3, 4]. Among these
modifications, protein ubiquitylation plays an important
role. Ubiquitylation of proteins can be proteasomedependent
or independent. Proteasome-dependent ubiquitylation
pathway involves various biological processes comprising
specific components, which make this pathway a
potential therapeutic target to develop new anti-malarial
drugs. Ubiquitin system participates in various cellular
functions as well as host-parasite interactions [3]. Ubiquitin
is a highly conserved 76 amino acids’ polypeptide that covalently
attaches to target proteins through the combined action
of three classes of enzymes namely, the ubiquitinactivating
enzyme (E1), the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
(E2) and the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) [5]. At the onset,
the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) activates ubiquitin
through an ATP-dependent reaction. In this reaction, the
terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin is adenylated and
transferred to an internal cysteine residue to generate a
high-energy thiol ester intermediate. The activated ubiquitin
is then transferred to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme
(E2), forming another thiol-ether intermediate, which then
specifically binds to the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). Lastly,
E3 ligase transfers the activated ubiquitin from E2 to the
side chain of a lysine residue of the target protein [3, 5].
Protein ubiquitylation can be monoubiquitylation (attachment
of one ubiquitin), multiubiquitylation (several ubiquitin
molecules attached to different lysine residues) or
polyubiquitylation (polyubiquitin chain generation) [4].
Ubiquitin E1 and E2, the two enzymatic components of
ubiquitylation system, are highly conserved within eukaryotes
[4]. However, P. falciparum E3 ubiquitin ligases are
considerably diverse and thus may serve as promising targets
for new antimalarial discovery [5]. The hypothesis behind
this study is that targeting the E3 ligases functions of
ubiquitin system would selectively kill the malaria parasite
and would be less toxic to the mammalian cells. A set of
standard E3 ligase inhibitors was tested against the chloroquine
(CQ)-sensitive P. falciparum D6 strain (PfD6) and
CQ-resistant P. falciparum W2 strain (PfW2) in vitro. The
selective antimalarial inhibitors were further investigated
to analyze the effect of E3 ligase inhibitors on intraerythrocytic
P. falciparum asexual life cycle development.
These studies suggest ubiquitin E3 ligases as potential
antimalarial drug targets and support previous reports
that the ubiquitin proteosomal degradation pathway may
be essential for the survival of the malarial parasite [4, 5].
Methods
Cell cultures
CQ-sensitive (D6, Sierra Leone) and -resistant (W2, Indochina)
strains of P. falciparum cultures were obtained from
Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center
(MR4), USA and maintained at 5% hematocrit in complete
culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 60 μg/mL
amikacin, 27 mM NaHCO3 and 10% heat-inactivated normal
human type A+ serum). The medium of the culture
was replaced every 48 h, flushed with a gas mixture of
90% N2, 5% CO2 and 5% O2 and incubated at 37 °C.
Vero cells and THP1 cells were maintained in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2. Both, Vero cells
and THP1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), USA having catalogue number
ATCC® CCL-81™ and ATCC® TIB-202™ respectively and
were subcultured twice a week.
Chemicals
Eight E3 ligase inhibitors namely, thalidomide, proTAME,
NSC 66811, Nutlin 3, HLI 373, JNJ 26854165, SMER 3
and NSC 146109 were used in the study. Thalidomide targets
cereblon (CRBN), which makes an E3 ubiquitin ligase
complex with damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1)
and cullin-4A (Cul4A). Thalidomide binds with CRBN
and inhibits the associated ubiquitin ligase activity [6, 7].
ProTAME, a cell-permeable prodrug, converts to an active
molecule, tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME) and inhibits
the ubiquitin ligase activity of the anaphasepromoting
complex/cyclosome (APC/C) [8, 9]. NSC
66811 and Nutlin 3 have been reported as MDM2 (Murine
Double Minute 2) E3 ligase inhibitors [10, 11]. JNJ
26854165 and HLI 373 are HDM2 (Human Double
Minute 2) E3 ligase antagonists. SMER 3 is an inhibitor of
a yeast SCF family E3 ubiquitin ligase (SCFMet30).
Thalidomide, NSC6811, NSC 146109 and SMER 3 were
purchased from Tocris Bioscience. Nutlin 3, JNJ 26854165
and ProTAME were purchased from Selleckchem, USA,
Axon Medchem, Netherland and Boston Biochem, Inc.
USA respectively. Chloroquine (CQ) was used as the positive
control, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as
vehicle control in this study. CQ and DMSO were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich, USA.
Antimalarial SYBR Green I-based fluorescence assay
CQ-sensitive P. falciparum D6 strain (Pf D6) and CQresistant
P. falciparum W2 strain (Pf W2) were grown in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with amikacin (60 μg/
mL), NaHCO3 (27 mM) and 10% heat-inactivated normal
human type A+ serum. Only ring stages of the parasite
were counted and adjusted to 2% parasitemia with 2%
hematocrit. Stock solutions (10 mM) of the test inhibitors
were prepared in DMSO. The compounds were serially diluted
in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium for testing at eight
concentrations. The maximum concentrations of E3 ligase
inhibitors and CQ used in the assay were 50 μM and 500
nM respectively. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5%
CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2 environment for 48, 72, 96 and
120 h. After incubation, SYBR green with RBC lysis buffer
was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for
1 h in the dark at room temperature. The standard antimalarial
agent, CQ was tested as the positive control, and
DMSO was tested as vehicle control. Standard fluorescence
was measured Fluostar Galaxy microplate reader (BMG
Lab Technologies) at excitation wavelength of 485 nm and
emission wavelength of 535 nm [12]. The anti-malarial
activity (expressed as IC50 values) was determined by the
dose-response analysis with XLfit©.
In vitro cytotoxicity assays against Vero and transformed
THP1 cells
The E3 ligase inhibitors were also tested against Vero cells
(African green monkey kidney epithelial cells) and transformed
non-dividing human monocytic (THP1) cells. The
methods described earlier were used to measure cytotoxicity
for Vero and THP1 cells [13, 14]. In brief, four days’
old Vero and THP1 cell cultures were diluted with RPMI
medium to 25,000 cells/mL. Vero cells (100 μL per well)
were seeded in a clear 96 well culture plate and incubated
for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator to obtain confluent
cells. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (25 ng/
mL) was added to THP1 cell culture to transform the cells
to adherent macrophages [15]. PMA treated THP1cells
were dispensed into clear 96 well culture plates (200 μL/
well; 25,000 cells/mL) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2
incubator for overnight. The test compounds were prepared
in DMSO at 10 mM concentration. The compounds
were serially diluted in RPMI medium with 2% FBS in the
separate daughter plates, for testing at eight concentrations.
The cells were washed with culture medium, replaced
with the fresh medium and test compounds were
added. The maximum concentration of E3 ligase inhibitors
and CQ used in these assays were 50 μM and 500 nM
respectively. DMSO was tested as vehicle control in these
assays. The plates were incubated further in a CO2 incubator
at 37 °C for 48 h. After 48 h, 10 μL of AlamarBlue®
was added to each well, and the plates were incubated in a
CO2 incubator at 37 °C for overnight. Standard fluorescence
was measured on a Fluostar Galaxy microplate
reader (BMG Lab Technologies) at 544 nm ex, 590 nm
em [13]. IC50 values were computed by analyzing doseresponse
curves with XLfit©.
Analysis of effect of E3 ligase inhibitors on P. falciparum
development (stage specific imaging analysis: antimalarial
assay)
The stage-specific activity of the lead compounds was
tested against Pf D6. The parasite culture was grown in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with amikacin
(60 μg/mL), NaHCO3 (27 mM) and 10% heat-inactivated
normal human type A+ serum. The culture was synchronized
by 5% sorbitol treatment as previously described
[16]. The synchronized culture of PfD6, with
~6% parasitemia and >90% of the parasite in ring stage,
was used for these assays. Stock solutions (10 mM) of
the test inhibitors were prepared in DMSO. CQ and active
antimalarial inhibitors namely, Nutlin 3, JNJ
26854165 and HLI 737 were tested at 50 nM, 35 μM,
5 μM and 5 μM concentration respectively for the stagespecific
antimalarial assay. These concentrations were
almost equivalent to the IC90 of the inhibitors against
PfD6 at 48 h. The effect of the compounds was monitored
after every 8 h (0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 h) by
preparing thin smears of the infected erythrocytes. The
slides were stained with Giemsa, and digital images of
the parasite were captured with Nikon Eclipse microscope
under bright field using NIS-element imaging software.
The images were analyzed for the parasite stages
and morphological changes (if any) in the parasite. The
levels of parasitemia and differential parasitemia (relative
percentage of different parasite stages) counts were also
measured. At least one thousand erythrocytes (total- infected
& uninfected) were counted from each slide for
determination of the the level of parasitemia and differential
parasite stage counts.
Statistical analysis
Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey and Sidak multiple
comparison test with GraphPad Prism 6 was used to
compare IC50 values of the inhibitors, the parasitemia
and also percentage of individual parasite stages.
Results
In vitro antiplasmodial activity of standard E3 ubiquitin
ligase inhibitors
The antimalarial activity of a set of E3 ubiquitin ligase
inhibitors was evaluated in vitro against PfD6 and PfW2
at eight different concentrations of each compound and
at four different time points (48, 72, 96 and 120 h)
(Table 1). Among the eight E3 ligase inhibitors tested
(Fig. 1), thalidomide and proTAME did not show noticeable
antimalarial activity against PfD6 and PfW2 up to
50 μM concentration and 120 h of exposure. E3 ligase
inhibitors, namely NSC 66811, SMER 3 and Nutlin 3
showed moderate antimalarial activity against both
PfD6 & PfW2. Antimalarial activity of above three inhibitors
against PfD6 was not significantly different
from the activity against PfW2 except SMER 3. SMER 3
showed significantly better antimalarial activity at 72 h
(p < 0.05) against PfW2 as compared to PfD6. NSC
146109, JNJ 26854165 and HLI 373 showed lower IC50
values (below 6 μM) against both PfD6 and PfW2 and
exhibited early growth inhibition. The IC50 values of
HLI 373 against PfD6 were significantly different and
were almost 2 fold higher against PfW2 as compared to
PfD6 at 48 (p < 0.05), 72 (p < 0.01), 96 (p < 0.01) and
120 h (p < 0.01). The antimalarial activity of JNJ
26854165 against PfD6 was significantly higher (lower
IC50 values) in comparison to PfW2 at 72 h (p < 0.05).
Similarly, NSC 146109 showed significantly better antimalarial
activity against PfW2 as compared to PfD6 at
48 (p < 0.0001) and 72 h (p < 0.001).
In vitro cytotoxicity of standard E3 ligase inhibitors
against Vero and THP1 cells-
The E3 ligase inhibitors tested for in vitro antimalarial
activity were also tested against Vero cells (African green
monkey kidney epithelial cells) and non-proliferating
THP1 (transformed human monocytic) cells for mammalian
cell cytotoxicity (Table 1). CQ, thalidomide, pro-
TAME, NSC 66811, Nutlin 3 and HLI 373 were not
toxic at the highest concentration tested. SMER 3 and
NSC 146109 were toxic against Vero cells, and their
IC50 values were not considerably different from corresponding
IC50 values against PfD6 and PfW2. However,
JNJ-26854165 was significantly less toxic to mammalian
cells as compared to PfD6 (p-value <0.001) and PfW2
(p-value <0.001). Therefore Nutlin 3, HLI 373 and JNJ-
26854165 were identified as selective antimalarial E3 ligase
inhibitors. CQ, thalidomide, and proTAME were not
toxic against THP1 cells at the highest concentration
tested. NSC 146109 and SMER 3 were toxic against
THP1 cells, and IC50 values of NSC 146109 was not
considerably different from corresponding IC50 values
against PfD6 and PfW2. The IC50 value of SMER 3 was
not considerably different from corresponding IC50
values against PfD6, although significantly different than
corresponding IC50 values against PfW2 (p-value <0.05).
NSC 66811 was not toxic against THP1 cells. Nutlin 3,
HLI 373 and JNJ-26854165 were considerably less toxic
against THP1 cells as compared to PfD6 (p-value <0.001,
<0.001 and <0.001 respectively) and PfW2 (p-value
<0.01, <0.001 and <0.001 respectively). Thus Nutlin 3,
HLI 373 and JNJ-26854165 were identified as selective
antimalarial E3 ligase inhibitors.
Evaluation of antimalarial ubiquitin ligase inhibitors on
growth and development of P. falciparum
The effects of lead antimalarial ubiquitin ligase inhibitors
namely, JNJ 26854165, HLI 373 and Nutlin 3 were
further tested against the asexual intra-erythrocytic development
of P. falciparum. These inhibitors showed
early effects on the parasite growth (Table 1) and therefore
were tested up to 48-h incubation period. The results
show the effects of inhibitors on overall levels of
the parasitemia (Fig. 2), and relative percentages of different
parasite stages namely rings, trophozoites and
schizonts (Fig. 3). Any morphological and cellular
changes in parasite development were determined by
analysis of digital images of the parasite exposed to these
inhibitors. The representative digital images of the parasite
stages and modifications in parasite morphology are
presented in Fig. 4. CQ was tested as a positive control,
and DMSO was tested as a vehicle control in this assay.
At 0 h the PfD6 cultures had ~ 6% overall parasitemia
and > 90% of the parasites were in ring stage. In PfD6
culture treated with vehicle control majority of the parasites
were transformed into trophozoites at 8 to 48 h,
The ratio of schizonts increased from 0 to 24 h and declined
at after 32 h (Fig. 3a). The overall level of parasitemia
did not change considerably in vehicle treated
PfD6 culture up to 48 h, as compared to 0 h (5.28% vs.
5.98%) (Fig. 2). CQ treatment significantly decreased the
overall parasitemia at 40 (p < 0.001) and 48 (p < 0.01)
hours, as compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 2a). In
CQ treated PfD6 cultures, around 50% of the parasites
were arrested at ring stage at 16 h post-treatment. Likewise,
more than 50% of the parasites were arrested at
ring stage at 40 and 48 h. Only a few parasites matured
into schizonts, which further declined after 32 h (Fig. 3b).
The change in differential parasite counts in CQ-treated
cells, at 48 h post-treatment, were statistically not significant
compared to control vehicle treated PfD6 culture,
due to large individual variations. However, the
rings detected in CQ-treated PfD6 cultures were apparently
healthy, but the trophozoites were shrunk (Fig. 4).
These results indicate that CQ kills the malarial cells by
blocking the growth of parasite at ring/schizont stage.
This reduction in parasitemia by JNJ 26854165 was
comparable to that of CQ at 40 (1.90% vs 2.40%) and
48 h (1.76% vs 1.92%), and was markedly reduced as
compare to control at 40 (1.9 vs 6.90; p < 0.0001) and
48 (1.76% vs 5.28%; p < 0.01) hours of treatment
(Fig. 2a and b). The parasites treated with JNJ
2648544858 apparently showed a different life-cycle
stage development pattern as compared to control.
The majority (~90% at 0 h) of the rings stage parasite
matured to trophozoites at 8 h. At 16 and 24 h the
majority of P. falciparum parasites were in ring and
trophozoite stages, and again trophozoites became
dominant at 40 and 48 h (Fig. 3c). The change in differential
parasite counts in JNJ2648544858 treated
cells at 48 h post-treatment were statistically not significant
compared to controls and CQ-treated PfD6
cultures due to large individual variations (Fig. 3).
However, distorted rings, trophozoites, and schizonts
were seen in PfD6 cultures treatment with JNJ
2648544858 at 40 and 48 h post-treatment (Fig. 4).
HLI 373 showed a significant reduction in parasitemia
at 40 h (p < 0.05) as compared to control (Fig. 2c). The
P. falciparum culture treated with HLI 373 showed
ring stages in the majority (~90%) at 0 h, while at the
remaining time points after the treatment (8, 16, 24,
32 and 40) majority of the parasite cells were at
trophozoite stage. Most of the parasite cells were at
schizont stage at 48 h after the treatment with HLI
373 (Fig. 3d). However, the change in differential parasite
counts in HLI 373 treated cells at 48 h posttreatment
were statistically not significant compared
to controls and CQ-treated PfD6 cultures due to large
individual variations (Fig. 3). The parasitemia was significantly
reduced in Nutlin 3 treated P. falciparum
culture as compared to control at 40 h (p < 0.001)
(Fig. 2d). In P. falciparum cultures treated with Nutlin
3 trophozoites were in the majority at 8, 16 and 40 h
post-treatment, whereas trophozoites and schizonts
were the dominating stages at 32 and 48 h posttreatment
(Fig. 3e). The change in differential parasite
counts in Nutlin 3 treated cells at 48 h post-treatment
were statistically not significant compared to controls,
and CQ-treated PfD6 cultures due to large individual
variations (Fig. 3). However, A large number of distorted
trophozoites and schizonts were observed in
HLI 373, and Nutlin 3 treated P. falciparum culture at
40 and 48 h post-treatment (Fig. 4).
Discussion
The ubiquitin system of P. falciparum is involved in numerous
cellular functions and host-pathogen interaction
[3]. The functions of ubiquitin system are essential for
progression of the malaria parasites’ life cycle [3]. The P.
falciparum genome contains more than 100 genes,
which putatively encode for the component associated
with the ubiquitin system. The P. falciparum ubiquitin
system contains four ubiquitins (PFL0585w, PF14_0027,
PF13_0346, and PF08_0067), eight ubiquitin-activating
enzymes (specific for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like
moieties), 14 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and more
than fifty E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. The proteomic
analysis of P. falciparum ubiquitome has shown that the
level of ubiquitin was more in rings and trophozoites
than in schizonts [4], which suggested that ubiquitylation
of proteins occurred more prominently in schizonts’
and might be necessary for schizonts’ maturation and
their further differentiation into invasive merozoites [4].
Among the components of ubiquitin pathway, E3
ubiquitin-protein ligase is the most variable and divergent
within eukaryotes and highly specific to the P. falciparum
parasite [4]. Thus, targeting essential parasite-specific E3 ligases
would be a promising approach for molecular targetbased
new antimalarial drug discovery [5]. E3 ubiquitinprotein
ligase catalyzes the transfer of activated ubiquitin to
the specific target protein. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases are
divided into three main classes on the basis presence of
specific domains namely, Homologous to E6-associated
protein C-terminus (HECT), Really Interesting New Gene
(RING) and U-box [3]. The standard E3 ligase inhibitors
tested in this study showed an early antimalarial effect after
the treatment, which was consistent up to 120 h. This suggests
that these inhibitors kill the parasites in the first asexual
cycle. However, some classes of drugs – specifically,
antibiotics like chloramphenicol, clindamycin, rifampin,
tetracycline, telithromycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin
show delayed killing of the malaria parasite in the second
cycle of parasite’s asexual reproduction [17]. These antibiotics
inhibit the protein synthesis in general, and the primary
target of antibiotic antimalarials in Plasmodium sp.
seems to be in the apicoplast. By inhibiting protein synthesis
and the apicoplast, these antibiotics cause a delayed
death phenomenon [17–20].
The E3 ligase inhibitors namely, JNJ 26854165, HLI 373
and Nutlin 3 were found to be active against both CQsensitive
PfD6 and CQ-resistant PfW2 and were less cytotoxic
against Vero and transformed THP1 cells. The two
E3 ligase inhibitors namely, JNJ 26854165 and HLI 373
are HDM2 antagonists. HDM2 is a RING finger E3-
ubiquitin ligase that acts as the predominant negative
regulator of p53 [10, 21–23]. JNJ 26854165, also known as
Serdemetan, is a tryptamine derivative and interrupts the
HDM2-p53 binding and is in phase 1 clinical trial for the
treatment of multiple myelomas [21, 22, 24]. Nutlin 3 is
an inhibitor of MDM2 (Murine Double Minute 2), an
oncogene and a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor
protein p53. Nutlin 3 blocks MDM2-p53 interaction
with potency in sub-nanomolar range with Ki value 36
nM [10, 25]. Like Nutlin 3, NSC 66811 also is an MDM 2
inhibitor with Ki value 120 nM but showed less prominent
activity against PfD6 and PfW2 as compare to Nutlin 3
[11]. ProTAME is a cell-permeable prodrug, which is converted
to its active parent molecule TAME. The parent
molecule inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC/
C by preventing its activation by Cdc20 and Cdh1 [8, 9].
The antimalarial active E3 ligase inhibitors arrested
the parasite growth at trophozoites stages resulting in
accumulation of distorted trophozoites and immature
schizonts. These observations are in agreement with previous
reports [5], which showed more predominant expression
of E3 ligase in trophozoites and early schizonts.
The ubiquitin/proteasome function may be essential for
maturation of P. falciparum trophozoites.
Conclusions
E3 ligase inhibitors namely, JNJ 26854165, HLI 373 and
Nutlin 3 showed prominent antimalarial activity against
both CQ- sensitive PfD6 and -resistant PfW2 strains. JNJ
26854165 showed considerably different activity against
PfD6 as compared to PfW2 at 72-h post treatment. Similarly,
the antimalarial activity of HLI 373 was considerably
different against PfD6 as compared to PfW2 at 48,
72, 96 and 120 h. However, Nutlin 3 did not show considerably
different activity against PfD6 as compared to
PfW2 at all four-time points. The inhibitors namely, JNJ
26854165, HLI 373 and Nutlin 3 were selectively active
against P. falciparum, and did not show cytotoxicity
against Vero and transformed THP1 cells. JNJ 26854165,
HLI 373 and Nutlin 3 apparently arrest the development
of P. falciparum growth at the trophozoites and schizonts
stage and cause accumulation of distorted trophozoites
and immature schizonts.
These results suggest that the function of ubiquitin/proteasome
may be crucial for schizont maturation in P.
falciparum parasite. Antimalarial E3 ligase inhibitors apparently
block trophozoites and schizonts maturation and
inhibit the intraerythrocytic development of malaria parasite.
Further investigations on the lead antimalarial E3 ligase
inhibitors would promise new understanding and
importance of E3 ligase function in the malaria parasite. It
may also provide a viable antimalarial-target and new classes
of antimalarial drug leads.
