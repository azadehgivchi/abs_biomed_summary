Background
Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a rare, life-threatening, 
inherited channelopathy associated with ventricular 
arrhythmia (VA) and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) [1]. 
The first reported clinical case was of familial short QT 
interval < 300  ms accompanied by arrhythmia [2]. After 
a while, familial sudden cardiac death (SCD) accompa-
nied with short QT interval and a history of syncope or 
palpitations was reported [3]. Later, SQTS was found 
to increase the risk of SCD, especially in young patients 
who were not previously diagnosed with any disease. The 
clinical and electrocardiogram (ECG) features, as well 
as clinical outcomes, remain unclear in Korean patients 
with SQTS. This is due to the rarity of the condition and 
the relatively short time since its discovery in Western 
countries. The aim of our study was to determine the 
clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with 
short QT interval (SQTI) in a Korean population.


Methods
Study population
This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study. The 
study design was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Yonsei University Health System (IRB approval 
number: 4-2019-0644), and the study was conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The institu-
tional review board waived both the need for the acqui-
sition of informed consent from patients to be included 
in the analysis and the need for review by a critical event 
committee owing to the study’s retrospective nature and 
the absence of patient identification data.
We included consecutive patients with SQTI from 
January 1999 to March 2019 in three university hos-
pitals in South Korea. SQTI was defined as a Bazett’s 
formula-corrected QT interval (QTc) ≤ 340  ms in serial 
ECGs regardless of symptoms or history of familial SCD. 
For estimating the QT interval, we used GE Healthcare’s 
12SL software (Milwaukee, WI, USA). A representative 
beat was generated from the selected segment of each 
lead, and then a composite beat was formed by the rep-
resentative beats of all independent leads. The global QT 
interval was considered as the longest QT interval in the 
multiple leads. Patients of all ages who met the SQTI def-
inition were included in the SQTI group, even in cases 
without related symptoms or a history of familial SCD 
(Fig. 1). The Exclusion criteria were as follows: temporary 
SQTI due to electrolyte imbalance (e.g. hypercalcemia, 
hyperkalemia), acidosis, hyperthermia, use of digitalis 
and cholinergic drugs which were related to clinical 
impairments, especially during hospitalization; struc-
tural heart disease with ischemic or nonischemic cardio-
myopathy; and significant (high-degree and third-degree) 
atrioventricular block (AVB). Age- and sex-matched 
subjects in the normal QT group were recruited in a 1:4 
ratio and had at least three ECGs with normal QTc which 
were performed from January 1999 to March 2019 in the 
outpatient clinic. Patients with overt cardiovascular dis-
ease, defined as cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, 
and significant bradyarrhythmia, were excluded. Clinical 
outcomes included arrhythmia outcomes and all-cause 
death. Arrhythmia outcomes included atrial fibrillation 
(AF), VA/SCA, and Mobitz type 2  s-, high-, and third-
degree AVB.
Data analysis
The following clinical variables were collected from 
all recruited subjects: age, sex, height, weight, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure, clinical history of loss of 
consciousness, palpitations, chest pain, SCA, the list 
of medications, familial history of SCA, accompany-
ing arrhythmias (AF, VA, premature ventricular com-
plex, supraventricular tachycardia, first-degree AVB, 
second-degree AVB, high-degree AVB, third-degree 
AVB), and ECG parameters (PR interval, QT interval, 
QT dispersion, heart rate, JT interval, biphasic negative–
positive T wave, early repolarization, and tall T waves). 
Tall T waves were defined as > 10 mm (1 mV) in any of 
the precordial leads.[4] QT dispersion was calculated as 
the difference between the maximum and minimum QT 
interval in the 12-lead ECG. JT interval was measured 
from the J point to the T wave peak. Early repolarization 
was defined as an elevation of the QRS–ST junction (J 
point) in leads other than V1–V3.[5]
We compared the baseline characteristics including 
symptoms, family history, ECG findings, and clinical out-
comes between the two groups.
Statistical analysis
The results are presented as median (interquartile range) 
for continuous data and as frequency (percentage) for 
categorical data. To compare the clinical parameters 
between groups, we used the Mann Whitney U-test for 
continuous data and Fisher’s exact test for categorical 
data since all data sets were non-normally distributed. 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were performed to determine the odds ratio of arrhyth-
mia in patients with SQTI. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25.0 
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).
Results
A total of 4,694,382 ECGs were performed in 2,083,360 
patients (both inpatients and outpatients) during the 
study period; 34 patients with SQTI were found, cor-
responding to a prevalence of 0.001%. These 34 patients 
[age, 23.5 (21.0–30.5) years; 31 male] with SQTI were 
followed up for 4.9 (2.0–7.8) years. Table 1 shows the 
baseline characteristics, medications, symptoms, and 
ECG characteristics of patients in the SQTI and nor-
mal QT groups. In the SQTI group, males younger than 
40  years were dominant (91.2%). The medications in 
the SQTI and normal QT groups were not significantly 
different except for digoxin (5.9% vs. 0.7%, P = 0.041); 
drugs that were known to shorten QT interval were 
not administered to patients in the SQTI and nor-
mal QT groups. Among the 34 patients with SQTI, 19 
patients (55.9%) visited the hospitals for the evalua-
tion of symptoms such as chest pain, chest discomfort, 
dyspnea, palpitations, and dizziness. The others had 
various causes of visiting the hospitals [hospitalization 
for other causes (n = 8, 23.5%), routine health check-
up (n = 4, 11.8%), preoperative evaluation for non-
cardiac surgery (n = 3, 8.8%) in order of frequency]. 
Symptoms included palpitations (n = 4, 11.8%), loss 

 
of consciousness (n = 3, 8.8%), and chest pain (n = 3, 
8.8%). Palpitations (11.8% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.030) were sig-
nificantly more frequent in the SQTI group than in the 
normal QT group. Regarding ECG findings, QT dis-
persion was significantly wider and heart rate was sig-
nificantly slower in the SQTI group than in the normal 
QT group. Early repolarization (n = 25, 73.5%), tall T 
waves (n = 20, 58.8%), and U waves (n = 4, 11.8%) were 
significantly more frequent in the SQTI group than in 
the normal QT group. There were no significant dif-
ferences in the frequencies of premature ventricular 
contraction and supraventricular tachycardia between 
groups. Among patients with SQTI, twelve patients 
underwent transthoracic echocardiography during the 
follow-up period, which revealed no structural cardiac 
abnormalities.

Table 2 shows the arrhythmia outcomes. AF (11.8% vs. 
2.2%, P = 0.030) was significantly more frequent in the 
SQTI group than in the normal QT group. Three patients 
experienced VA/SCA in the SQTI group, whereas no 
patients experienced VA/SCA in the normal QT group 
(8.7% vs. 0%, P = 0.007). One patient had ventricular 
fibrillation and underwent cardioverter-defibrillator 
implantation (Fig.  1a). Another patient had ventricu-
lar tachycardia but he refused cardioverter-defibrillator 
implantation and was lost to follow up. The other patient

had SCD. There were no significant differences in the 
occurrence of significant AVB between the groups. Mul-
tivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and 
sex showed that SQTI was independently associated with 
AF [odds ratio, 7.834; 95% confidence interval, 1.387–
44.258; P = 0.020] and VA/SCA (a statistical comparison 
could not be performed because the incidence of VA/
SCA in the normal QT group was zero) (Table 3).
Discussion
Main findings
The main findings of the present study are as follows: (1) 
the prevalence of SQTI was 0.001%; (2) QT dispersion 
was significantly wider and heart rate was significantly 
slower in patients with SQTI than in those with a nor-
mal QT interval. Early repolarization, tall T waves, and 
U waves were more frequent in patients with SQTI than 
in patients with normal QT interval; and (3) SQTI was 
significantly associated with AF and VA/SCA.
SQTS diagnostic criteria
Multiple studies have suggested diverse diagnostic crite-
ria for SQTS; definite diagnostic criteria for SQTS have 
not been properly established since the condition was 
first identified. Initially, a constant QT interval ≤ 300 ms 
was regarded as a short QT interval.[3] After major 
population studies, the suggested diagnostic criteria for 
SQTS were a QTc ≤ 340  ms or a QTc ≤ 370  ms in the 
presence of a pathologic mutation; familial history of 
SQTS or SCA at < 40 years of age; or a history of VA in 
a structurally normal heart, AF in early life, or loss of 
consciousness that might be strongly related to a cardiac 
arrhythmia [6].
Sex differences in SQTI
The majority of patients with SQTI were male and 
between 20 and 30 years of age. It is known that the QT 
interval is shorter in men than in women [7], which may 
be attributable to the effect of testosterone on the QTc [8, 
9].
Symptoms
Over 35% of patients with SQTI had symptoms at pres-
entation; these included, in decreasing frequency, palpi-
tation (n = 4, 11.8%), loss of consciousness (n = 3, 8.8%), 
and chest pain (n = 3, 8.8%). A previous study showed 
that the most frequent symptoms were palpitations and 
syncope, which is in accordance with the present study 
[10]. The cause of loss of consciousness may be self-ter-
minating VA in patients with SQTS [11].
ECG characteristics
A previous study demonstrated that early repolarization 
was associated with arrhythmias in patients with SQTS 
and could be used for identifying the risk of SCA in 
SQTS [12]. Tall T wave is one of the characteristic ECG 
findings in SQTS [12]. QT dispersion was significantly 
wider in the SQTI group than in the normal QT group in 
the present study. It is known that increases in repolari-
zation dispersion are the possible substrate for reentry, 
which may result in VA and SCA [11]. A previous study 
also found that patients with SQTS had significantly 
wider QT dispersion [13].
Arrhythmia outcomes
AF was the most frequent arrhythmia in the SQTI group 
in the present study. A prior study reported that 18.0% of 
patients with SQTS had AF [14]. Given the close associa-
tion between SQTS and AF, the latter is included in the 
SQTS diagnostic criteria. This relationship was found to 
be attributable to a common KCNQ1 missense mutation 
(V141M), which caused AF and shortened the QT inter-
val by altering the gating of  IKs channels [15]. Approxi-
mately 5.8% of patients experienced VA at the initial 
SQTI diagnosis.
Limitations
The present study has a number of limitations. First, 
a small number of patients were included in the pre-
sent study because SQTI is a rare condition. Large-scale 
prospective studies of patients with SQTI are needed.

Second, genetic studies were not performed in patients 
with SQTI. Third, subjects with normal QT interval 
were recruited not from the general population but from 
among hospital visitors; this was decided since ECG is 
not routinely performed in the general population. How-
ever, subjects with normal ECG findings and without 
any cardiovascular disease were included to avoid selec-
tion bias. Fourth, conditions such as a history of physi-
cal activity and emotional status, which can affect QT 
interval, were not assessed because of the retrospective 
design.
Conclusions
In this cohort of Korean population, SQTI was associated 
with AF and VA/SCA. It is important to note that SQTI 
and AF have close relationship with common KCNQ1 
mutation (V141M) and when SQTI is detected by taking 
an ECG, it is necessary to actively monitor for syncope, 
AF, and VA.
