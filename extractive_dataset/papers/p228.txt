Background
Asset indices are widely used proxy measures of individual
and household wealth in studies and surveys conducted
in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) due
in part to their ease of collection and estimation [1–3].
Such indices are proxy measures of ‘long-run’ income,
poverty and wealth, and are closely associated with nonfood
expenditures [4, 5]. Patterns of asset ownership
allow researchers to place households on a continuum
along the wealth spectrum [6]. Validation studies show
moderate to high associations of household asset indices
with other manifest measures of socioeconomic status
(such as schooling and income) and correlations with individual
measures of health (such as childhood stunting
and adult overweight) [4, 7–10]. Asset indices are expected
to reveal wealth gains over time in growing economies.
However, unavailability of longitudinal asset data
over the life course is a significant barrier to exploring
such gains for individuals or individual households [11].
The comparability of asset indices over time and between
contexts is an active area of research in social sciences
in the last decade [1, 3, 11–13].
The most commonly used procedure for development
of an asset index for a sample consists of selection of
items for inclusion, categorization of levels, specification
of the correlation matrix and factor extraction [2]. A
valid index developed should display theoreticallyexpected
associations with external measures such as
schooling, income or consumer expenditure. Potential
problems in constructing an index include changing importance
of assets over time reflected in item loadings
for a pooled asset index versus cross-sectional indices, as
well as the capacity of items to differentiate households
(for example in what are often quite different urban versus
rural settings). Given the paucity of longitudinal data
in LMIC, as well as the scale and velocity of economic,
demographic and epidemiological changes, it is important
to understand patterns of wealth accumulation over
the life course for 80% of the world’s population [14–
16]. These patterns of wealth accumulation could reflect
trajectories of social mobility which are associated with
adult health outcomes.
In this paper, we develop and estimate an asset index,
comprising durable assets and housing characteristics
for members of a birth cohort (and their families) from
four villages in rural Guatemala, harmonized over a 50-
year period of study follow-up [17]. The Guatemalan
economy is the largest in Central America, with modest
growth rates of 3.5% per annum in the last five years.
Guatemala is the fifth poorest country in the Latin
America and Caribbean region, with high rates of poverty
and inequality [18]. A low share of average tax burden,
personal income taxes and social spending has led
to inadequate provision of health, education and other
public services. Since the onset of SARS-CoV2,
Guatemala has experienced substantial loss of employment
and disparities in access to schooling, worsening
existing vulnerabilities [19, 20]. Alongside Guatemala as
a whole, the study villages have undergone transformative
social and economic changes in the last 50 years [21,
22]. Literacy and schooling outcomes have improved
over the study period, on par with national averages.
Road and transportation have also improved steadily
over time resulting in better access to non-agricultural
jobs. Over the duration of the study, GDP per capita
(USD, 2010$) for Guatemala has risen from $1692 in
1967 to $3160 in 2018 [23]. We estimate its crosssectional
association with parental schooling and
attained schooling of cohort members. We study how
patterns of cross-sectional loadings change over time
and between urban and peri-urban/rural settings at different
points in time. We then assess the robustness of
the benchmark index to omission of assets, study waves
and to the use of alternative statistical methods.
Methods
Study population
The Institute of Nutrition of Central America and
Panama (INCAP) conducted a cluster randomized trial
in four rural villages matched on population size and
density in the Department of El Progreso, Guatemala
from 1969 to 1977 [24]. The INCAP Oriente Longitudinal
Study in Guatemala is the longest running birth
cohort in any LMIC [25, 26]. Two villages were randomly
assigned to receive an energy and protein drink,
Atole. The other two villages were assigned a low energy
drink with all energy derived from sugar, Fresco. Details
of the supplementation and study, as well as characteristics
of the 2392 cohort members (comprising all individuals
ages 0 to 7 living in the villages at any point during
the 1969-77 study period) have been described previously
[25]. The unit of observation in this study is the
household in which a cohort member resided in each
study wave.
Data collection and variable specification
Durable assets and housing characteristics
Information on contextually appropriate durable assets
which were contextually appropriate was collected from
households with a cohort member residing in any of the
four villages (as part of village censuses conducted) in
the 1967, 1975, 1987 and 2002 study waves, and from
households of all cohort members interviewed in the
2015–16 and 2017–18 study waves regardless of residential
location (Supplementary Notes 1 and 2). Depending
on the age and sex of the individual, it could be their
own house, parents’ house or marital house. Cohort
members were born between 1962 and 1977 so that in
1975 those who had been born were between 0 and 13
years old and in 2017–18 between 40 and 57 years old.
Individual items were queried until they became irrelevant
or negligible in value (e.g. record player) and additional
new items including computer, telephone (fixed
or cell phone) and washing machine added as they became
available [6]. Only ownership of each item was collected
and not information on the quantity, quality or
functioning, technological generation and substitute
assets.
Characteristics of the residence also were collected.
These included ownership of house and land, number of
rooms, material used for construction (floor, roof and
wall), whether there was electricity, location of the kitchen,
medium of cooking, sanitation, and sewage facilities.
We categorized non-binary housing characteristics
into low and high quality based on expert opinion. We
created rooms per member, an indicator of crowding,
such that a higher number reflects greater wealth [27].
We assume no information bias from self-report of ownership
and housing characteristics [28]. Details are provided
in Supplementary Table 1.
All participants gave written informed consent before
participation. All methods were performed in accordance
with the relevant guidelines and regulations.
Schooling
Attained years of schooling was collected for parents of
cohort members. Attained schooling of cohort members
was collected in adulthood during the 2015–16 and
2017–18 study waves. The participants were asked
“What is the highest grade that you successfully
completed?”
Statistical analysis
Sample and changes in composition over survey waves
We compare early life characteristics (parental schooling,
atole supplementation, year of birth and sex) of
households of cohort members who resided in their original
village in 1987 and 2002 versus households of cohort
members who did not reside in the original villages.
We also compared those interviewed and not interviewed
in recent waves (2015–16, 2017–18). We do not
have information on the households of cohort members
in 1987 or 2002 if they were not residing in their original
study village at the time.
Construction of the harmonized asset index
For greater comparability to previously published work,
we included ownership (yes/no) of radio, record player,
sewing machine, refrigerator, television, bicycle, motorcycle
and automobile. We included house ownership,
land ownership, rooms per member, quality of housing
construction (floor, roof, walls), whether the house had a
separate kitchen, formal cooking medium, sanitary installation,
improved water source and availability of electricity
[17, 29]. We imputed ownership of land, record
player, sewing machine, television, motorcycle and automobile
as zero for the 1967 wave when they were not
asked. We imputed ownership of record player for 2002
and onwards as zero. We pooled all study waves (1967,
1975, 1987, 2002, 2015–16, 2017–18) into a single dataset
for the main analyses. Since siblings were included in
the original cohort in early waves, the number of households
does not equal number of cohort members. The
2392 individuals recruited during the period 1969–77
come from 816 unique households. In the 2015–16 and
2017–18 waves, 176 and 240 individuals from the 1163
and 1265 who were followed up are married to each
other. We therefore include household as the unit of
observation.
Various approaches for constructing asset indices have
been described in the literature, of which the most common
is principal component analysis (PCA) [5]. PCA is
a statistical procedure that projects data points from the
real number space onto a set of orthogonal ‘principal
components’ such that the first component explains the
maximum variance in the original data, and each subsequent
component explains the maximum remaining
variance. We performed PCA on a correlation matrix
created from the pooled dataset of binary variables comprising
ownership of durable assets, housing characteristics
and crowding as a continuous variable. We retained
the first component from the PCA as the harmonized
asset index [2, 17]. Some research has explored the potential
of higher order principal components to explain
other dimensions of wealth (such as agricultural wealth).
Because these components are uncorrelated with the
first principal component and in this context did not
display interpretable loadings for housing characteristics,
we did not consider them [5, 30].
We visually assessed the empirical distributions for
clumping and truncation, examining histograms for each
study wave [3]. Clumping occurs when many households
have the same value of index due to limited variation in
ownership and housing characteristics. Truncation is the
failure to differentiate between relatively low or high
levels. Both of these phenomena are ideally resolved by
including additional suitable assets or characteristics (or
quality, quantity or other information about them)
which could differentiate at points along the distribution
of the index.
Usage of PCA with binary variables has been criticized
for violating assumptions of linearity and normality. Although
PCA does not impose constraints on each variable,
it assumes a multivariate normal distribution of the
variables for components to be independent. Alternative
procedures have their corresponding strengths and
limitations. For instance, Multiple Correspondence Analysis
(MCA), which is a suitable alternative to PCA for
categorical data cannot be used with continuous data.
Polychoric/tetrachoric PCA assumes bivariate normal
distributions between latent variables which form the
observed discrete variables. In practice, these methods
tend to produce indices that are highly correlated [31].
We assessed correlation of the harmonized asset index
with cross-sectional schooling-related measures of SES
among cohort members (parental schooling in 1967–75
and own attained schooling in 2015–16 or 2017–18).
Sensitivity analysis
We also constructed cross-sectional indices (S1) with
the same set of indicators used in the harmonized index,
stratifying by region of residence (urban, rural) of cohort
members in the final two waves. We also assessed the
Spearman rank correlation of the harmonized index with
a separate index constructed by including newer assets
introduced in 2002 and later (S2; video player, sound
system, computer, telephone, washing machine and sewage
system) after imputing the newer assets as zero for
earlier waves (1987 and before).
We report the Spearman rank correlations of the harmonized
index with alternative indices to assess the sensitivity
to dropping assets and study waves (S3), the
structure (S4) of the correlation matrix (Pearson, polychoric)
and the factor extraction method (PCA, Exploratory
factor analysis, MCA), categorization of housing
characteristics into ordinal (S5; low, medium, high). Exploratory
factor analysis assumes an underlying factor
which give rise to the observed distribution of assets
and housing characteristics. MCA is a generalization
of PCA when variables are categorical. We converted
crowding into a binary variable for the MCA with
values greater than 0.75 rooms per person set to 1
and otherwise 0. Additional information on the various
sensitivity analyses is provided in Supplementary
Note 3. We carried out our analysis using R 3.5.1 and
tidyverse 1.3.0 [32, 33].
Results
Comparison of baseline characteristics of cohort
members
Data on assets were available for 547 households of cohort
members in 1967 and 755 in 1975 (totalling 1302), covering
2073 of the 2392 cohort members. Durable asset and
housing information was unavailable for the remaining
319 individuals in both 1967 or 1975. Information on cohort
members by survival and participation in 1987 and
later study waves is available in Table 1. Of the original
members, 2023 were known to be alive, and data on 1388
residing in Guatemala were collected in the 2015–16 or
2017–18 waves. The majority of the deceased died prior
to 1987 (236 out of 385), most in early childhood. Households
of cohort members who died were similar in wealth
to those who were alive (as measured by the harmonized
index at baseline, described below). In 1987, compared to
those for whom asset data is available, those for whom
data is unavailable were older (born in 1968 vs 1972) and
more likely to be female (56.8% vs 44.2%). Also compared
to those for whom asset data is available, those for whom
asset data is unavailable in 2002, 2015–16 and 2017–18
had fathers with higher median attained schooling (2 vs 1
years) compared to those whose asset data is available. Cohort
members with and without asset data were otherwise similar to those whose data is unavailable (study wave;
2002, 2015–16, 2017–18).
Durable assets and housing characteristics
Living standards in households of cohort members improved
over time (Table 2). Ownership of electronic
goods such as a television or refrigerator increased over
time, especially from 1987 onward, while the proportion
owning a radio increased until 1987 and then later decreased.
Ownership of motor vehicles (motorcycle, automobile)
also increased over time. Ownership of the
house has been consistently high (84% in 1967 and 83%
in 2017–18). However, the average number of rooms per
member nearly doubled from 0.61 in 1967 to 1.13 in
2017–18. Land ownership decreased from 1975 (74%) to
2002 (53%) and subsequently increased (67%). We observed
a large increase in sanitation (5% in 1967 to 99%
in 2017–18). Only a small proportion of households
(11%) had electricity in 1975 but nearly all (97%) did by
2017–18. Ownership of appliances like refrigerator (1%
in 1967 to 71% in 2017–18), television (1% in 1975 to
92% in 2017–18) and computer (1% in 2002 to 31% in
2017–18) also increased over time. By 2017–18, nearly
all households (96%) possessed a telephone (fixed or cell
phone).
Harmonized index construction
Table 3 shows loadings on each indicator for the harmonized
index in the first column and, then indices constructed
for sensitivity analyses. The first principal
component of the harmonized index explained 32.4% of
the variance in the pooled data. Standardized loadings of
the principal components are positive for ownership of
each individual asset except radio (− 0.05). The largest
positive loadings were for television (0.34), high quality
floor (0.33), sanitary installation (0.33) and electricity
(0.33). The lowest loadings were for record player
(0.004), house ownership (0.03) and land ownership
(0.07). Cronbach’s alpha for the items and Kaiser-Meyer-
Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy were 0.84
and 0.91 respectively.
Visual inspection of histograms (Supplementary Figure
1) of the benchmark harmonized index (pooled, and
separately by study wave) indicates clumping (limited
range of data values) for early study waves (1967, 1975
and 1987). The index displayed truncation at the lower
tails of the distribution in the early study waves but not
for later ones or for the upper tails of the distributions.
A summary of harmonized asset index scores across
study waves is presented in Table 4. As households acquired
additional assets the mean increases across study
waves. The mean harmonized index score in the observed
sample increased from − 3.76 in 1967 to 1.92 in
2017–18 while the SD increased from 0.91 in 1967 to
1.51 in 1987 but then declining to 1.09 by 2017–18. The
inter-quartile range (3rd quartile – 1st quartile) of harmonized
index scores increased from 1.35 in 1967 to
2.01 in 1987, after which it decreased to 1.26 in 2017–
18. Most cohort members (99.8%) observed in 2017–18
experienced gains in the absolute level of the harmonized
index for their household in adulthood relative to
early life (Fig. 1). For those who did not participate in
2017–18, we observe a similar increase to the wave in
which they were last observed. The harmonized index is
positively associated with measures of schooling, another
important indicator of socio-economic status: maternal
schooling (with 1967 or 1975; r = 0.16), paternal schooling
(with 1967 or 1975; r = 0.10) and attained schooling
in adulthood (with 2015–16 or 2017–18; r = 0.35).
Sensitivity analysis
Cross-sectional indices constructed separately for each
individual study wave using the same set of assets (S1;
r ≥ 0.91) and urban-rural stratified indices for each of
the final two waves (r ≥ 0.90) were also correlated with
the harmonized index. We display the loadings of these
different cross-sectional indices in Table 3 and their correlations
with benchmark harmonized index in Table 5.
An index including newer available assets (S2; video
player, sound system, computer, telephone, washing machine
and sewage) was correlated (r ≥ 0.91) with the
benchmark harmonized index.
The harmonized index was robust to omission (S3) of
any pair of assets (r ≥ 0.97; Supplementary Table 2), any
one or two study waves (r ≥ 0.96; except for omission of
1967 and 1975 where r = 0.91; Supplementary Table 3)
and joint omissions of each single asset with each study
wave (r ≥ 0.95; Supplementary Table 4). These results
suggest that the index is stable even when we do not include
assets or study waves such that an index created
from a sparser dataset would be largely similar to the
benchmark index. Alternative specifications of the correlation
matrix and factor extraction methods (S4) on
the pooled sample indicated a high correlation (Table 5)
with the harmonized index based on PCA (range: 0.96–
1.00). Asset indices constructed by re-specifying housing
characteristics (as described in Supplementary Table 1)
into three categories (S5; low/medium/high) were also
highly correlated (PCA: 0.96, EFA: 0.92) with the original
index.
Comparing cross-sectional indices for survey waves
when cohort members were in adulthood (2002, 2015–
16, 2017–18), ownership of refrigerator (loadings: 0.35
to 0.40), television (loadings: 0.34 to 0.37) and high quality
flooring (loadings: 0.31 to 0.38) have the highest loadings.
In general from 1967 to 2017–18, the loadings of
housing characteristics such as the roof and walls decrease
while those of assets increase. However, items
such as house ownership (2015–16; loading = 0.37) and
land ownership (loading = 0.36) have high loadings for
the urban sample. Ownership of a television (loading =
0.35) and high quality floor (loading = 0.36) have high
loadings within rural sample.
Discussion
We attempted to develop a temporally harmonized asset
index from consistently administered surveys in a cohort
setting. Such an index can be used to study the impact
of socio-economic mobility on measures of human capital
in adulthood. For cohort members followed over a
period of 50 years, an asset index created by pooling
study waves shows an increase in absolute wealth over
time. The constructed harmonized asset index was robust
to various sensitivity analyses. Our analysis
demonstrates wealth gains over time in a birth cohort
from a LMIC setting. A harmonized index for a birth cohort
is an improvement over repeated cross-sectional
surveys because it permits the estimation of both the
population mean trajectory, quantifying cross-sectional
variation within the cohort and understanding trends in
household wealth of the analytic sample over the followup
period. Additionally, a harmonized index allows
examination of trajectories of absolute wealth mobility
over the life course and sensitivity of timing of wealth
gains for human capital [34].
The results suggest a divergence or increased inequality
in household wealth from 1967 to 1987 followed by a
partial convergence in 2002. The observed pattern could
reflect the transition of cohort members residing in the
villages (typically in their parental homes) until adolescence
and then the process of forming their own households.
The period from 1987 to 2002 was marked with
economic changes such as the transition from agricultural
to non-agricultural jobs, increased access to electricity,
piped water and increased ownership of electronic
appliances such as televisions [22].
A cross-sectional analysis of item loadings demonstrate
how importance of housing characteristics and assets
in differentiating households changes over time. The
temporally harmonized index was highly correlated with
cross-sectional indices for each study wave on its own.
Cross-sectional comparisons of urban and rural households
indicate how house ownership differentiates
households in urban areas while housing characteristics
and ownership of electronic goods are better differentiators
in rural areas. This potentially reflects the higher
cost of owning houses in urban areas rendering it a
stronger indicator of wealth. Similar to a study from
Zimbabwe, we observed correlations of the pooled index
with indices stratified by rural (and urban) residence
[35]. Despite the few observed differences, the loadings
are similar in magnitude over time and between settings
for most items included such that developing a temporally
harmonized index was feasible in our sample.
The index displayed internal consistency (or monotonicity)
such that loadings for all assets, except radio, were
positive [11]. The largest loadings were for electricity, television,
high quality flooring and sanitary installation. Descriptive
analysis shows that ownership of radios increased until
1987 and subsequently decreased reflecting changing consumption
patterns. The index was robust to dropping
items, study waves, alternate indicator categorization or
specification of the correlation matrix and factor extraction
method. The stability of the index despite dropping pairs of
items indicates that at least in our sample, exclusion of infrastructure
items (such as electricity) or housing characteristics
do not change our results. The lower correlation
when excluding 1967 and 1975 (r = 0.91) is likely due to
fewer households having televisions, separate kitchens and
high quality roofing in those waves – resulting in different
loadings before and after exclusion. Consistent with earlier
studies from other settings, indices derived from alternative
procedures including EFA, MCA or polychoric PCA are
highly correlated with the PCA-derived index suggesting
that the final selection of which method to use does not
matter substantively [2, 16, 31, 36]. The index displayed
construct validity with external measures as shown by positively
associations with both parental and attained schooling,
consistent with previous results from Latin America [37].Overall, the results from sensitivity analyses are consistent
with previous research on stability of such indices in similar
contexts [3, 11, 31, 38–40].
Our index has limitations inherent to the nature of data
and methodology. A limited set of assets is available, computations
need to be repeated on addition of future
rounds, characteristics of assets are not available (quality
or functioning, quantity, technological generation, substitute
assets) and potential conflation of within year and between
year variance [30]. The index displayed clumping
and truncation at lower values in the early waves. The four
study villages in 1967 and 1975 were similar to other poor
rural areas of Guatemala at the time. Solving issues of
clumping and truncation, however, would require addition
of assets that increase variability at points along the index.
Unfortunately, we did not have such assets which were
collected during these study waves. Expanded assets, however,
do not change rank order in a country which has experienced
economic change similar to other countries.
Measures of rural wealth such as farmland or pastoral
land, agricultural equipment and livestock which could
differently represent both pooled and cross-sectional rankings
were not available [11, 41]. Previous research conducted
towards developing a multidimensional poverty
index suggested that consumer durables are able to sufficiently
differentiate households in rural areas [42]. Barring
these limitations, our index provides a descriptive understanding
of trends in wealth in a cohort studied consistently
for over 50 years from a growing economy.
Conclusions
Our approach enables examination of the association of
absolute (material pathways) and relative (psychosocial
pathways) wealth mobility over the life course with other
important outcomes including health and well-being [43,
44]. There are increasing numbers of longitudinal studies
in LMIC settings and our study provides guidance
for researchers for assessing long-term trends in household
wealth. Our research suggests that consistentlyadministered
asset indices are useful to study associations
of changes in wealth in relation to human and social
capital development over time in a cohort setting.
We encourage researchers working in LMICs to collect
contextually relevant, consistent measures of wealth.
