Background
Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which de-
velops from prostate cancer but is resistant to androgen-
deprivation therapy [1], is the leading cause of death in
prostate cancer [2, 3]. The high mortality rate of CRPC
is mainly due to metastases to the bone and/or brain [4,
5]. Currently, mainstay treatments for CRPC include
surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunother-
apy [1, 6]. Among them, chemotherapy is the first choice
for oncologists in terms of treating metastatic CRPC.
The majority of approved chemotherapeutic drugs kill
cancer cells by introducing a DNA damage response [7].
Cancer cells are endowed with a similar or even stronger
innate DNA-repair capacity compared to that of normal
cells [8], which can limit the effectiveness of approved
agents in treating cancer and/or may lead to chemother-
apy failure [9]. With these concerns, an inexpensive re-
agent that enhances DNA damage and inhibits DNA
repair may have a potential advantage as a CRPC thera-
peutic drug, as identification of drugs that target DNA
damage with low side effects in normal cells remains a
challenge in CRPC chemotherapy.

Willd (Fabaceae) leaves René Dofini Magnini1,2,3* , Mathieu Nitiéma2, Geoffroy G. Ouédraogo2, Sylvain Ilboudo2,4, Alimata Bancé2,3, Hassanata Millogo-Koné2, Carole Di Giorgio5, Jean-Marie Pagès1, Adama Hilou3 and Anne Davin-Regli1 Abstract Background: Acacia senegal is a plant traditionally used for its various properties, including the treatment of infectious diseases. Recently, our team has demonstrated the ability of the hydroethanolic extract of the leaves to increase the activity of phenicol antibiotics against multi-resistant bacteria. The aim of this work is to determine the toxicological effects of the extract and its capacity to inhibit the bacterial mobility of Gram-negative bacteria, in order to evaluate the level of safety use of this plant. Methods: The cytotoxicity test was performed using the neutral red absorption method. Acute and sub-acute oral toxicity were conducted on NMRI mice and Wistar rats. The behaviour and adverse effects were recorded during the 14 days of the acute study. For the subacute test, biochemical parameters, food and water consumption, and morphological parameters were determined. The anti-motility activities were evaluated on Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 and Escherichia coli AG100, using specific concentrations of Agar as required by the method. Results: HEASG induced inhibition of keratinocytes cell growth with an IC50 of 1302 ± 60 μg/mL. For the acute toxicity study in mice, the single dose of extract of 2000 mg/kg body weight caused no deaths and no behavioural changes were observed; therefore, the median lethal dose (LD50) of HEASG was calculated to 5000 mg/kg body weight. In Wistar rats, no mortality was observed at 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day during the 28-day subacute oral toxicity study. The weights of both females and males increased globally over time, regardless of the batch. No statistically significant differences were registered for organ weights and biochemical parameters, except for chloride for biochemical parameters. Water and food consumption did not change significantly. Furthermore, no macroscopic changes in organ appearance were observed. Regarding anti-motility activity, the extract has reduced the swarming motility of PA01 and AG100 significantly at the concentration of 32 μg/mL (P < 0.001). The extract has reduced the swimming motility (P < 0.01) of PA01 but not AG100. Conclusions: The results suggest that hydroethanolic extract of A. senegal leaves has significant activity against bacterial motility and relatively low toxicity.

long been used in Chinese herbal and Indian Ayurvedic
medicine [10]. Recently, PL has received increased atten-
tion from researchers due to its anticancer effects [11,
12]. Mechanistic investigations have revealed that PL
achieves anticancer effects via a reactive oxygen species
(ROS)-dependent pathway [13] and modulates related
signaling
pathways,
including
MAPK,
NF-κB,
and
STAT3 pathways [14–20]. In the last decade, PL has
been demonstrated to exhibit anticancer efficacies as
well as sensitize the anticancer activities of chemothera-
peutic drugs (e.g., doxorubicin) against prostate cancer
cells [14, 21, 22]. However, the effects of PL on DNA
damage and repair in CRPC cells have remained unclear.
Hence, our present study investigated and identified the
effects of PL on DNA damage and repair in CRPC PC3
and DU145 cells, which are derived from bone and brain
metastasis of CRPC.
Methods
Cell cultures and reagents
CRPC cells (PC3 and DU145), the human normal pros-
tatic stromal myofibroblast cell line (WPMY-1), and the
human normal hepatic cell line (LO2) were purchased
from the Cell Resource Center of Peking Union Medical
College. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in
Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco) that
was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PPA-GE,
Marlborough, MA), as well as 100 U/mL of penicillin and
streptomycin (HyClone-GE, Marlborough, MA). N-acetyl-
L-cysteine (NAC) was purchased from Beyotime Biotech
(China). PL was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Item Num-
ber: SML0221), with a purity of ≥97%.
Determination of cell viability
The cell viabilities of PC3, DU145, WPMY-1, and LO2
cells were assessed via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays [23]. Cells
(4 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates) were incubated at
37 °C with or without PL treatment for 48 h, after which
MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was added at 20 μL/well for another
4 h. The reaction product, formazan, was dissolved in
100 μL of DMSO after discarding the culture medium.
Cell viability was determined by reading the absorbance
at 560 nm by a spectrophotometer (DTX880, Beckman
Coulter, CA, USA).
Cell adhesion assays
Cell adhesion assays were performed as described previ-
ously [24]. A 96-well plate was coated with 50 μL of hu-
man fibronectin (2.5 μg/mL) in 1 × PBS (Millipore, CA) at
4 °C overnight. Cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a
density of 4 × 104 cells/well and were cultured for another
1 h at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were then
rinsed three times with 10% formalin and stained with
crystal violet for 5 min at room temperature. After three
washes with double-distilled H2O (ddH2O), stained cells
were dissolved in 100 μL of acetic acid (33%). The absorb-
ance at 560 nm was detected by a Synergy H1 Multi-
Mode Reader (BioTek). The relative number of cells
attached to the extracellular matrix was calculated using
the following equation: mean optical density (OD) of
treated cells/mean OD of control cells. Cells treated with
vehicle (0.01% DMSO) were used as a control.
Transwell assays
Transwell assays were performed as described previously
[24] and carried out according to a purchased transwell
kit (Corning Costar, NY) following the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Briefly, cells were pretreated with different con-
centrations of PL for 48 h and were then reseeded into
transwell permeable support (insert) pre-equilibrated with
serum-free DMEM medium. For each group, 1 × 105 cells/
insert were seeded and incubated in 100 μL of serum-free
DMEM medium. The insert was then placed in a 24-well
plate containing 600 μL of DMEM medium with 10% FBS.
After 24 h of culturing, cells on the upper surface of the
insert were removed with cotton-tipped swabs. Then, the
cells on the backside surface of the insert were fixed with
10% formalin, stained with crystal violet for 5 min at room
temperature, and washed three times with ddH2O. Stained
cells were dissolved in 500 μL of acetic acid (33%), and
their absorbances were detected at 560 nm by a spectro-
photometer (DTX880, Beckman Coulter, CA, USA).

Scratch-wound assays
Cell scratch-wound assays were performed as described
previously [24]. The cells were seeded in a six-well plate
at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well and were cultured in
medium containing PL or 0.01% DMSO for 48 h. A de-
nuded area was created across the diameter of the dish
by a yellow tip. The cells were washed with PBS and
then incubated in a serum-free medium. Phase-contrast
images were acquired at the indicated times of incuba-
tion. Images were analyzed with Axiovision Rel.4.8 soft-
ware. The percentage of areas covered by migrated cells
(i.e., wound recovery) was calculated. Three independent
experiments were carried out for quantification.
Annexin V/PI apoptotic assays
The Annexin V/PI method was applied for apoptotic as-
says (Sigma) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were seeded in 10cm2 dishes at a density of 5.0 ×
105 cells per dish and were incubated at 37 °C overnight.
PL at the indicated concentration was then added into
the medium. After long-term cell proliferation assays or
scratch-wound assays, cells were harvested for anexin V/
PI apoptotic assays. These assays were performed follow-
ing the protocol provided by the Annexin V/PI Apop-
tosis Kit (Sigma) and were assessed via a flow cytometer
(BD FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences).
Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β gal)
activity
A beta-galactosidase (SA-β gal) staining kit was obtained
from Sigma. The assay was performed following the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells were washed
once with PBS and fixed with stationary liquid provided
in the kit at room temperature for 15 min. Next, the
cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the dark with
1 mL of a working solution containing 0.05 mg/ml of 5-
bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal).
Subsequently, the cells were observed under a normal
light microscope (Nikon, Japan).
Long-term cell proliferation assays
Long-term cell proliferation assays were performed ac-
cording to a previous study [25]. Long-term cell prolifer-
ation experiments were carried out in PC3 and DU145
cancer cell lines. First, 5.0 × 105 cells were seeded into
10-cm2 dishes and incubated for 6 h to ensure that cells
were completely adherent to the extracellular matrix.
Second, PL at the indicated concentrations (i.e., 1.0, 2.0.
or 4.0 μM) or DDP (4.0 μM) was added to the medium
for another 72 h. Third, the cells were harvested, and the
total number of cells was then counted. Finally, 5.0 × 105
cells were reseeded into 10-cm2 dishes, and the above
steps were repeated. The medium was changed every 3
days until confluence was reached. Quantification was
performed as follows: 2PDs = M/N, where PDs denote
population doublings, M is the number of counted cells,
and N is the number of implanted cells.
Immunofluorescence (IF) assays
Immunofluorescence (IF) assays were performed as previ-
ously described [26]. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% para-
formaldehyde and permeabilized via 0.5% Triton X-100.
Subsequently, cells were incubated with primary anti-
bodies against focal adhesion kinase (FAK; CST) or 53BP1
(CST) and were then incubated with secondary antibodies
(DyLight 488-conjugated anti-Rabbit). The cells were
mounted with DAPI and/or phalloidin (CST). Fluorescent
images were captured with a Nikon Ti microscope.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays
ROS was quantified using a ROS kit (Sigma) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cellular ROS levels
were measured by flow cytometry. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells
were plated onto six-well cell culture plates and allowed
to attach to the wells overnight. Thereafter, adhered cells
were treated with PL (1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 μM) in the presence
or absence of NAC (5 mM) pre-treatment for 2 h. After
removal of the medium, the ROS indicator, DCFH-DA
(10 μM), was added to fresh FBS-free medium and incu-
bated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were then
collected, and fluorescence was analyzed using a FACS
Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, CA).
DAPI staining
After long-term cell proliferation assays, PC3 and DU145
cells were re-seeded in six-well cell culture plates at a
density of 5 × 105 cells/well. After 6 h of incubation (dur-
ing which cells adhered completely to the extracellular
matrix), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at
room temperature for approximately 15 min, after which
they were washed three times with PBS prior to DAPI
staining. Cells were observed using a Nikon fluorescent
microscope.
Comet assays
DNA damage was evaluated by comet assays [27]. Cells were
first mixed with 0.5% low-melting-temperature agarose be-
fore being transferred onto slides, which were coated with
1.5% normal agarose. Then, cells on these slides were lysed
in 2.5-M NaCl, 10-mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100-mM EDTA, 0.5%
Triton X-100, 1% N-lauroylsarcosine, and 3% DMSO. Elec-
trophoresis was carried out in 300-mM sodium acetate, 100-
mM Tris-HCl, and 1% DMSO. The slides were then
mounted with PI solution (20 μg/ml) and visualized under a
Nikon fluorescent microscope and analyzed by CASP.

Western blotting
Total proteins were extracted and boiled for 10 min at
95 °C. Samples were separated via SDS-PAGE gels, trans-
ferred to a PVDF membrane, and then blocked with 5%
nonfat milk in TBST for 2.5 h at room temperature.
Blots were subsequently probed with relevant primary
antibodies against FAK (CST), γ-H2AX (Millipore),
cleaved PARP (CST), Bcl2 (Millipore), p53 (Santa), RPA
(Santa), KU70 (Santa), XRCC4 (Santa) and β-actin (Pro-
teintech) overnight at 4 °C. Finally, the blots were de-
tected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and
visualized using a Westar Supernova kit (Cyanagen).
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 5 was used for statistical analysis. In
histograms, all data were represented by mean ± SD of at
least three replicates for each experiment. The statistical
significance of the data was assessed by student’s two-
tailed unpaired t-test or Two-way ANOVA with the p-
values (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001).
Results
PL possesses stronger anticancer activity than that of
taxol, cisplatin (DDP), doxorubicin (dox), or 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU) in CRPC cells, with fewer side effects in normal
cells
First, the effects of PL on cell viabilities of CRPC cells
(PC3 and DU145), the normal prostatic stromal myofibro-
blast cell line (WPMY-1) and the normal hepatic cell line
(LO2) were evaluated. Taxol, DDP, Dox, and 5-FU were
selected as positive-control drugs in the present study, as
they are the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs
against CRPC that are used clinically. The results showed
that PL possessed stronger or comparable anticancer ac-
tivity with fewer side effects in normal cells when com-
pared with those of all other positive-control drugs that
were tested (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1).
PL inhibits CRPC cell migration by modulating the
expression and distribution of FAK
Cell adhesion assays were performed to determine the
capability of cells to adhere to the extracellular matrix
with or without PL treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A and
B, PL treatment resulted in a significant concentration-
dependent decrease in cell adhesion to the extracellular
matrix at concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 μM.
Cell adhesion is known to be correlated with cell mi-
gration [28]. Therefore, scratch-wound healing assays
were performed to determine the migration rate of PC3
and DU145 cells with or without PL treatment. The data
indicated that PL significantly inhibited cancer cell mi-
gration (Fig. 1C and E). After a 24-h treatment, only
15% of the scratch area was uncovered by migrated PC3
cells in the control group, while 71% of the scratch area
was uncovered following treatment with 4.0 μM of PL
(Fig. 1D). Similarly, treatment with 4.0 μM induced a sig-
nificantly lower migration rate in PL DU145 cells (Fig.
1F). To exclude the possibility of interference from cell
death
induced
by
PL,
FACS
assays
and
beta-
galactosidase (SA-β gal) staining assays were used to
evaluate apoptotic and senescent cells immediately after
scratch-wound healing assays. The results showed that
PL did not induce significant apoptosis or senescence
during the cell migration assay (Supplementary Figure
2), indicating that PL-induced inhibition of cell migra-
tion was not induced by apoptosis/senescence.
In order to further determine the inhibitory effects of
PL on PC3 and DU145 cell migration, transwell migration
assays were carried out. The quantitative data suggested
that PL-treated PC3 and DU145 cells possessed weaker
transferability compared to that of untreated cells (Fig. 1G
and H). These results were consistent with the above re-
sults from our scratch-wound healing assays (Fig. 1).
Since precisely controlled cell deformations are vital to
cell migration [29], we speculated that PL might affect
the expression and function of cytoskeletal proteins in
PC3 and DU145 cells. F-actin is not only the most abun-
dant cytoskeletal protein but also a crucial protein for
cell stability, morphogenesis, and motility [29]. Mean-
while, FAK is a cytoplasmic kinase that is essential for
cell migration and morphogenesis [30]. Both F-actin and
FAK contribute to cell migration and adhesion; hence,
we speculated that PL might inhibit CRPC cell migration
and adhesion by affecting the expression and distribu-
tion of FAK and F-actin. Therefore, IF and Western-blot
assays were performed using FAK and phalloidin anti-
bodies. The IF results showed that weak fluorescence
(FAK) was observed in PL-treated cells, whereas FAK
was expressed at a much higher level in the control
group (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Figure 3A). More-

(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Figure 3B). In addition, West-
ern blotting further showed that PL efficiently decreased
the expression of FAK, especially p-FAK (Fig. 2C-F). Taken
together, these findings support the conclusion that PL
inhibited the migration of CRPC cells via suppressing the
expression and distribution of FAK at the edge of the cells.
PL effectively inhibits proliferation of CRPC cells and
induces cell death by increasing ROS
High levels of ROS, which are correlated to cell fate,
were found to induce both cell-cycle arrest and cell
death in PL-treated PC3 and DU145 cells (Supplemen-
tary Figure 4). First, the effect of PL on cell proliferation

was determined by long-term cell proliferation assays.
The results indicated that the proliferation of PC3 and
DU145 cells was significantly inhibited by PL in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and B). Since
the induction of apoptosis is associated with modulation
of PARP [31] and Bcl-2 [32], we also visualized cleaved
PARP and Bcl2 content via Western blotting. The results
indicated that PL treatment had no noticeable effect on

the expression of cleaved PARP but slightly down-
regulated the expression of Bcl2, an important anti-
apoptotic associated protein, in PC3 cells (Fig. 3C and
D). Conversely, PL significantly increased the content of
cleaved PARP protein at 4.0 μM but had little effect on
Bcl2 in DU145 cells (Fig. 3E and F). As expected, ele-
vated cleaved PARP protein expression was absent after
pretreatment with the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC) (Fig. 3C and E). Taken together, these data indi-
cate that PL treatment may result in different cell fates
in PC3 and DU145 and that these effects are mediated
by ROS, especially in PL-treated DU145 cells.
The status of the tumor-suppressor gene, p53, is null
in PC3 cells but mutated in DU145 cells, and contributes
to differential cell fates [33–35]. Therefore, both annexin
V/PI apoptotic assays and SA-β gal staining assays (Fig.
3G-J and Supplementary Figure 5) were carried out to
detect the cell fates of PC3 and DU145 cells. H2O2-
treated cells were used as a positive control (Fig. 3G and
Supplementary Figure 5C). The flow cytometry results
showed that immediately after long-term cell prolifera-
tion assays (PL treatment for 12 days), the apoptotic
ratio was not changed in PL-treated PC3 cells (Supple-
mentary Figure 5A and B), whereas PL significantly
induced cell senescence (Fig. 3G and H). Conversely, PL
treatment induced apoptosis in DU145 cells with con-
comitantly increased expression of p53 (Fig. 3I-K), while
senescent cells were undetectable (Supplementary Figure
5C and D). Furthermore, we examined nuclear morph-
ology in PL-treated or untreated CRPC cells immediately
after long-term proliferation assays. The results showed
that more than 70% of PL-treated DU145 cells had
apoptotic nuclei (73.2 ± 2.1%), including condensed nu-
clei (Supplementary Figure 6). In contrast, PL-treated
PC3 cells and controls appeared to exhibit intact oval-
shaped morphologies, and their nuclei did not appear to
be as apoptotic.
PL treatment induces persistent DNA damage
FAK and ROS can affect DNA damage as well as the
DNA damage response (DDR) [36, 37], and unbalanced
DNA damage and repair will result in apoptosis and/or
senescence [33]. Therefore, comet assays and IF assays
were carried out to examine the effects of PL on DNA
damage and the DDR in CRPC cells. As expected, PL
caused increased DNA damage in PC3 cells, resulting in
DNA fragments that formed a tail shape during electro-
phoresis (Fig. 4A-C). These results were consistent with
the data from our IF assays, which showed that the
number of 53BP1 foci in PL-treated PC3 cells was sig-
nificantly increased in a concentration-dependent man-
ner (Fig. 4D and E). In addition, similar results were
obtained in PL-treated DU145 cells (Supplementary Fig-
ure 7). The increased expression of γ-H2AX, a marker
of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), in PL-treated
CRPC cells (Fig. 4F-I) further supported the conclusion
that PL triggered substantial DNA damage and the DDR
in CRPC cells. Moreover, we found that PL treatment
resulted in no change in amount of replication protein A
(RPA), which plays a role in DNA strand invasion during
homologous recombination (HR) [38]. In contrast, PL
treatment suppressed the expression
of KU70 and
XRCC4, the marker of non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) [39], in a concentration-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure 8A and B). Additionally, we also
tested DNA damage in PL-treated, positive-control-
treated, or untreated human normal LO2 cells using an
antibody against 53BP1; subsequently, the number of foci
per nucleus was then calculated. Our data showed that
compared to those following taxol, DDP, Dox, or 5-FU
treatments, less 53BP1 foci were detected in PL-treated
LO2 cells, indicating that PL induced less DNA damage in
human normal LO2 cells (Supplementary Figure 9).
To explore the consequences of DNA damage, both
PC3 and DU145 cells were treated with PL at a dose of
10 μM for 3 h. Cells under this condition did not exhibit
any senescence (Supplementary Figure 10A and B),
apoptosis (Supplementary Figure 10C and D), or cell-
cycle arrest (Supplementary Figure 10E-H). After PL
treatment, the media was immediately replaced with PL-
free medium, and cells were fixed at the indicated times
(0, 2, 4, 8, 24, or 48 h). The fixed cells were then used in
comet assays and IF assays. The data from comet assays
showed that PL treatment triggered numerous DNA le-
sions in PC3 and DU145 cells, resulting in DNA lesions
that left the nucleus and formed tail shapes during the

values were still maintained within 48 h after PL-
treatment (Fig. 6A and B). Next, we performed western
blots to examine the abundance of HR-related protein
RPA and NHEJ-related protein XRCC4 in 10 μM PL
treated-PC3 and DU145 cells at different time (0 h, 4 h,
8 h, 24 h and 48 h). The results showed that 10 μM PL
treatment obviously reduced expression of RPA and
XRCC4, and increased expression of p53 (Supplemen-
tary Figure 11A and B). These results revealed that DNA
damage induced by PL may not be repaired in CRPC
cells. Consequently, Annexin V/PI apoptotic assays indi-
cated that 10 μM PL significantly induces DU145 cells
apoptosis in time-dependent manner, but slightly in-
duces apoptosis in PC3 cells, which may attribute to the
expression of p53 (Supplementary Figure 11C-F). Taken
together, these data support the conclusion that PL
treatment induced intense DNA damage in CRPC cells.
Discussion
Androgen deprivation (ADT) is a major strategy for
mitigating advanced prostate cancer; however, the cure
success rate of ADT is low, and most patients eventually
develop CRPC [6]. Moreover, 90% of CRPC patients
develop metastases with a high mortality rate, for which
chemotherapy is the preferred clinical treatment [1].
Chemotherapy achieves anticancer effects via causing
substantial DNA damage [9]. However, chemotherapy
often fails after long-time treatment due to enhanced
capacities of DNA repair in cancer cells [9]. Additionally,
long-time chemotherapy often leads to serious toxic side
effects. Thus, there has been an urgent need to identify a
chemotherapeutic drug that possesses preferential effects
against cancer cells without causing serious adverse side
effects in normal cells. Our present results indicate that
PL exhibited a broad spectrum of antitumor activities in
CRPC cells, independent of p53, and induced lower
cytotoxicity than that of cisplatin or taxol in normal
cells, as well in WPMY-1 and LO2 cells (Table 1 and
Supplementary Figure 9).
Considering that migration is the leading cause of
cancer-related deaths [5, 28], a drug capable of effect-
ively inhibiting the migration of cancer cells has poten-
tial
therapeutic
value.
In
our
present
study,
we
demonstrated that PL-treated CRPC cells exhibited de-
creased adhesion to the extracellular matrix (Fig. 1A and
B). Accordingly, a decreased migration speed (Fig. 1C-F)
and an attenuated ability to traverse a membrane from
the serum-free to serum side (10% FBS) in the transwell
assay (Fig. 1G and H) were observed in PL-treated CRPC
cells. FAK, a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, is
overexpressed and activated in a majority of cancers, in-
cluding prostate cancer. FAK localizes to focal adhesions
and it is activated by extracellular signals including
integrin-mediated adhesion, which further leads phos-
phorylation of Tyr397 and activate downstream signaling
pathways, contributes to the metastasis and invasion of
prostate cancer cells [40]. Our study showed that PL
inhibited the expression and distribution of FAK at the
leading edge of cells as well as inhibited phosphorylation
of Tyr397, and PL-treated cells presented a decreased
cell-spreading area in a concentration-dependent man-
ner (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure 3). Given the im-
portance of F-actin and FAK in cell adhesion and
migration, we propose that PL inhibited the adhesion
and migration of CRPC cells by suppressing the expres-
sion and distribution of FAK in CRPC cells. Therefore,
FAK is a potential effective target to inhibit migration of
prostate cancer.
Previous studies have demonstrated that PL exhibited
potent anticancer effects by activating ROS [13, 41] and
high ROS levels induce substantial DNA damage [37].
Since the integrity of DNA is crucial to cell viability and
metastasis of cancer cells, sufficient DNA damage can
cause cell-cycle arrest and cell death [7]. The results of
our present study indicated that PL suppressed CRPC
cell proliferation and induced cell death (Fig. 3) at low
concentrations (i.e., 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 μM) by provoking
intense DNA damage and inducing a strong DDR and
inhibiting the DNA repair process (Fig. 4, Supplemen-
tary Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure 8). Furthermore,
we found that the different cell fates of PL-treated PC3
(senescence) and DU145 (apoptosis) cells may be the
result of multiple factors, including a differential p53
status between these cell types (Fig. 3K), as well as
differential changes in PL-induced protein expression
and apoptosis (Fig. 3C and D). Taken together, these
data suggest that PL might achieve anticancer effects
through ROS-mediated DNA damage and inhibition of
repair pathways in a p53-independent manner. There-
fore, the PL-induced fate of these DNA lesions in CRPC
cells is worthy of further investigation.
Cancer cells have a high tolerance to genotoxicity via
DNA repair and/or reversal of epigenetic defects [7]. In
addition, an imbalance in redox equilibrium may cause
serious DNA damage, and FAK inhibition can also result
in persistent DNA damage [36, 37]. As expected, our
present results demonstrated that PL induced substantial
DNA damage in CRPC cells (Figs. 5 and 6), which may
have been attributed to a substantial imbalance in redox
equilibrium (Supplementary Figure 4) and FAK inhib-
ition (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure 3). In addition,
DNA damage repair approach including HR and NHEJ
for DSB were impeded in PL treated PC3 and DU145
cells (Supplementary Figure 8, Supplementary Figure
11A and B). As a result, substantial DNA damage and
DDR accumulation-initiated inhibition of cell migration
(Fig. 1) and a cell death response (Fig. 3).

Conclusions
In
conclusion,
our
present
results
found
that
PL
efficiently inhibited the migration and proliferation of
CRPC cells and induced cell death in a concentration-
dependent manner. Moreover, the results indicated that
PL treatment would regulate the expression and distri-
bution of FAK and the intracellular ROS levels. Further
mechanism studies showed that PL achieved both anti-
proliferation and anti-migration activities by triggering
intense DNA damage in CRPC cells.
