At any given time, 5–8 % of the general population aged
60 and over are living with dementia, and it is expected
that 152 million people in the world will have dementia
by 2050 [1]. The impact of dementia is far reaching,
as it affects not only the person with dementia, but also
their family carers, the healthcare system and society as
a whole [1]. Dementia is often unrecognized, and there
is an underuse of diagnostic assessment tools and a lack
of attention to the issues faced by family caregivers [2].
Approximately 65 % of dementia cases are undiagnosed
in primary care, which negatively impacts these patients
by not implementing advanced care planning and management
strategies before the dementia progresses
[3]. The U.S Preventative Services Task Force recommends
that clinicians assess cognitive functioning when
a patient is suspected of cognitive impairment based on
the physician’s observation or caregiver concerns [3].
Canadian consensus guidelines similarly do not recommend
asymptomatic screening, but instead suggest use
of validated screening tools if there is clinical concern for
a cognitive disorder [4]. Common neuropsychological
screening tools administered by family physicians (FPs)
include the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and
Clock Drawing Test (CDT) [3]. However, it is not clear
that these are the best screening tools for use in primary
care.
Time constraints are often an issue for family doctors
as it relates to diagnosing and managing dementia.
The time allocated for a typical office visit makes
it challenging to perform a cognitive assessment [5].
FPs often feel uncertainty regarding the management
of dementia after a diagnosis has been made [5]. This
highlights the current need to better optimize dementia
care within primary care. The objective of this systematic
review of systematic reviews was to determine
the most effective evidence-based strategies to diagnose
and manage dementia within primary care. Specifically,
we seek to understand what practices FPs can
undertake to ensure accurate and timely testing and
management.
Methods
This systematic review was conducted in accordance
to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines [6], and the protocol
is registered in Open Science Framework [DOI
https:// doi. org/ 10. 17605/ OSF. IO/ E4AW5]. All data generated
or analysed during this study are included in this
published article in Additional file 1: Appendixes 1 and
2. A systematic review of systematic reviews was determined
to be the past method to further summarize and
tailor the current body of literature on this topic into a
format that would address the existing evidence to practice
gap.
Data Sources
The systematic literature search was developed in consultation
with a health sciences librarian, with the final
search being completed 11 May 2020. The following databases
using the Ovid platform were searched without a
restriction to publication date: MEDLINE, EMBASE,
PsycINFO and The Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews. We searched the following clusters of search
terms: Family Practice and Dementia. In each category,
we used controlled vocabulary such as Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) as well as keywords. Within each cluster,
terms were combined with OR, and between the clusters
with AND. We then used CADTH search terms for
the systematic review study designs [7] (Additional file 1:
Appendix 1). The reference list of a previous relevant systematic
review of systematic reviews published in 2014
was also searched [8].
Study Selection
Systematic reviews were considered if they met the following
inclusion criteria.
• Population: Primary care or family practice settings
seeing persons with dementia.
• Intervention: The detection, diagnosis, treatment
and/or management of dementia including models of
care, pathways and/or protocols.
• Comparators: Usual care, wait-list control or other
interventions within the scope of the review.
• Outcomes: The description of the detection, diagnosis,
treatment or management strategies, along with
measures of their acceptability, efficacy or effectiveness
in the provision of care.
• Study design: Systematic review, either quantitative
or qualitative.
Articles were also selected for inclusion if they were
English-language articles, included relevant descriptions
of the interventions used, and outcome data was available.
Two reviewers (B.F and J.H.-L.) independently screened
the titles and abstracts for possible inclusion. If either
reviewer thought the citation was relevant or potentially
relevant, the full-text article was then retrieved for further
evaluation. All full-text articles were assessed independently
for inclusion by B.F and J.H.-L. Any conflicts
were resolved through discussion. One reviewer (B.F.)
independently extracted the following information from
the included full-text studies using a standardized data
extraction form: authors, year of publication, country
where the review was conducted, number of studies
Results
The initial search identified 417 unique citations for
possible inclusion after duplicates were removed.
After searching the reference list of a relevant previous
systematic review of systematic reviews [8], three
additional citations were collected and screened for
eligibility. After screening the 420 citations, 369 were
excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria.
From the 51 full-text articles screened, 30 articles
were excluded. Reasons for exclusion include not being
a systematic review (n = 20), describing a setting other
than primary care (n = 1), failing to describe the intervention
(n = 3), or a poor AMSTAR 2 rating (n = 6).
This resulted in the inclusion of 21 articles (Fig. 1). The
included studies were published between June 2003 and
July 2019.
Screening tools
Nine [10–18] out of the 21 included systematic reviews
describe screening tools for use in primary care
(Table 1). Various screening tools, assessing cognitive
impairment or dementia, were compared in terms of
cognitive outcomes assessed, time to administer, and
sensitivity and specificity. The MMSE was used as a reference
standard in the majority of the included studies.
The Mini-Cog (n = 5) and the MMSE (n = 7) were the
most widely studied tools among the included reviews.
The Mini-Cog takes approximately 3 min to administer,
and sensitivity ranges from 76 to 100 % and specificity
from 27 to 93 % [10, 12, 14, 17] depending upon the cutoff
value used.
Five systematic reviews examining the MMSE
found that it took between 4 and 15 min to administer
depending upon the severity of dementia [12–16].
One study found a cut point of 17 had a higher specificity
(93 %, 95 % CI: 89-96 %) than a cut point of 24
(46 %, 95 % CI: 40-52 %), while the sensitivity fell from
100 % (95 % CI: 95-100 %) to 70 % (95 % CI: 59-80 %)
respectively [16].
The Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) achieved
high sensitivity (100 %, 95 % CI: 70-100 %) and specificity
(82 %, 95 % CI: 72-90 %) [12] compared to a clinical
reference standard, and took the shortest amount of
time (3.16 to 5 min) [12, 14] within primary care. The
AMTS was validated for use in general practice [12].
Diagnostic accuracy and physician education
The diagnosis of dementia by FPs varies but is generally
low, as reported in 3 different systematic reviews [11,
16, 19]. In an (urban/rural) study, when following usual
practice, only half of cases of mild dementia were diagnosed
by the FP [19]. In a separate review, un-diagnosed
dementia accounted for 50 − 66 % of all cases of dementia
in three primary care samples studied [11, 20−22].
Another review reported that the recognition of cognitive
impairment in usual practice achieved a detection
sensitivity of 62.8 % (95 % CI: 38.0-84.4 %) and specificity
of 87.3 % (n = 3; 95 % CI: 84.9-89.4 %) [16]. However,
medical record notations mentioning dementia were
present in only 37.9 % (95 % CI: 26.8-49.6 %) and FPs
recorded a definitive dementia diagnosis in the medical
record in only 10.9 % (95 % CI: 6.8-15.7 %) of mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) cases [16].
Five of six studies found that FPs had an increased
likelihood of suspecting dementia after attending an
educational seminar [23, 24]. One study found that the
length of the educational seminar impacted the degree
of knowledge about dementia management [24].
Management of dementia
Decision aids, advanced care planning (ACP), collaboration
with a case manager (CM) and practice guidelines
are all interventions with variable impact on helping
facilitate the management of dementia in primary care
[23, 25−29] (Table 2). A CM in particular, such as a nurse
specialized in care of older adults, can be an asset to a primary
care team with the collective goal of collaborating
towards meeting the needs of the patient-caregiver dyad
[30]. In the case management intervention group of a
randomized controlled trial, neuropsychiatric symptoms
of dementia decreased (Mean Effect Size (MES) = 0.88),
as well as the numbers of hospital (MES = 0.66) and
emergency department admissions (MES = 0.17) [26].
However, it was found that there was a lack of successful
implementation of a CM into care teams within primary
care because of the absence of CMs within the primary
care setting, and 52 % of CMs reported ineffective communication
between the CM and FPs [26].
Only one systematic review looked at pharmacological
treatments in the context of primary care [11]. There was
no clinically important difference observed on neuropsychiatric
symptoms between patients with mild to moderate
Alzheimer’s disease taking cholinesterase inhibitors
versus placebo [11].
Supporting caregivers of people with dementia
FPs reported feeling highly involved in dementia care
[31]. However, family caregivers reported that communication
with the FPs was unsatisfactory, specifically
around awareness of daily care problems (e.g. neuropsychiatric
symptoms) [31]. The primary care educational
intervention, Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregiver
Health (Department of Veterans Affairs) (REACH
VA), involves a trained coach who provides sessions to
the caregiver on topics relating to self-care, problem solving,
mood management and stress management [32].
REACH VA was successful at increasing carer ability to
manage problem behaviours and improved outcomes
for caregivers, such as decreased burden, depression and
caregiving frustrations [30, 31]. A meta-analysis showed
that 58 % (95 % CI: 43-72 %) of family caregivers were in
favor of early dementia diagnosis, 50 % (95 % CI: 35-65 %)
needed education on dementia, and 23 % (95 % CI:
17-31 %) needed in-home support [33].
Discussion
This systematic review of systematic reviews identified
evidence to inform processes for diagnosis and management
of dementia within primary care. While the diagnostic
accuracy of a tool may be high, the time taken to
administer the tool and copyright limitation for tool use
are also important to consider in the context of a busy
primary care office. The MMSE, which is copyrighted,
may not be the best test for use in general practice.
Instead, the AMTS appears to be the most suitable tool
for use in a busy primary care office, as it has good diagnostic
accuracy, does not appear to be copyright protected
and takes less time to administer than the MMSE
[12, 14, 15]. The Mini-Cog is also quick to administer, and
a Cochrane systematic review evaluating the Mini-Cog
across care settings recommended that the Mini-Cog
be used initially as a case finding test to identify patients
who would benefit from additional cognitive evaluations
for dementia [34]. However, the sensitivity of the Mini-
Cog may not be high enough to be considered useful in
primary care [17], as too many cases would be missed.
The current literature suggests that the implementation
of case management directly into the primary care setting
can be of great benefit to the patient-caregiver dyad,
as well as to the health care system. The CM can help
facilitate the advanced care planning process [29], as well
as decrease the frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms
of dementia, symptoms of depression, hospital admissions
and length of stay in hospital; caregivers can also
benefit by experiencing decreased burden and depression
[26]. A Cochrane review evaluating the effectiveness of
case management in community settings lends support
to dementia case management, finding that carer burden
decreased and fewer patients where institutionalized
after 6 months [35]. Further, there was a reduction in
residential home and hospital use after 6 months of case
management implementation [35]. There is however a
lack of evidence related to cost effectiveness of case management.
Facilitating successful case management and
advanced care planning includes early implementation
while cognitive decline is mild, involving all stakeholders
(caregiver, patient, family and FP), and fostering a good
relationship between the FP and patient-caregiver dyad
[29]. The CM should be physically present in the primary
care setting, clearly explain their role to all stakeholders,
implement high-intensity case management, and communicate
frequently to all stakeholders in order to ensure
positive outcomes for the patient-caregiver dyad [26, 27].
Combining educational seminars for FPs with dementia
case management may be the best management strategy
[23, 24]. Educational interventions focused on dementia
diagnosis and management in the context of primary
care increased the likelihood of FPs suspecting dementia,
while also improving the experience of the family caregiver
and the patient [23, 24].
There was limited evidence concerning the use of pharmacological
interventions for the treatment of dementia
within the primary care setting. Unfortunately, many
pharmacologic studies do not focus on primary care or
FPs, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the
approach to take regarding the use of medications in
this context. One systematic review found no clinically
important differences between groups receiving cholinesterase
inhibitors and those receiving a placebo in the
development of behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms
of Alzheimer’s disease [11]. Similarly, cholinesterase
inhibitor use was found to have uncertain clinical benefit
in a recent systematic review that explored the benefits
and harms of prescription drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer
disease, regardless of care setting [36]. This recent
review also found limited benefit for memantine.
Conclusions
The AMTS is suitable for detecting dementia within primary
care given its high sensitivity and short administration
time. To improve dementia identification, FPs
should participate in educational interventions. Incorporation
of CMs into the primary care team can help
with dementia management and result in improved outcomes.
There is limited evidence supporting the benefit
for pharmacological treatments in the context of primary
care.
