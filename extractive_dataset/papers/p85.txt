Background
Low hemoglobin (Hb) levels are strongly associated with 
an increased risk of mortality in various clinical condi-
tions, including acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, 
and chronic kidney disease [1–3]. In addition, recent 
studies have found that both low and high Hb levels are 
related to increased mortality, suggesting a U-shaped

relationship [4–6]. This might imply the existence of a 
clinically beneficial level of Hb even within the normal 
Hb range. However, there is a paucity of data on this 
issue, especially on the relationship between Hb levels 
and subclinical atherosclerosis.
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a premorbid condi-
tion characterized by multiple metabolic disorders, 
with insulin resistance as a major component [7, 8]. The 
prevalence of MetS is rapidly increasing worldwide, and 
this entity affects approximately 31% of Korean adults 
[9, 10]. A number of previous studies have revealed that 
MetS is strongly associated with atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular (CV) disease and its related complications [11, 
12]. In clinical practice, early detection of atherosclero-
sis is important for primary prevention in the asympto-
matic general population [13]. Moreover, the treatment 
of atherosclerotic disease at an earlier stage and more 
precise patient selection are emphasized for primary pre-
vention [14]. Previous landmark studies demonstrated 
that the assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis using 
carotid ultrasound, ankle-brachial index determination, 
and coronary calcium score calculation offered benefits 
for improved CV risk prediction beyond traditional risk 
factors [15–17]. In particular, the presence of carotid 
plaque is known to improve the prediction of new-onset 
CV disease based on the overall baseline CV risk status 
[15]. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the 
association among serum Hb level, MetS, and the risk of 
carotid plaque formation, focusing on the comparison 
with the lowest category of Hb in asymptomatic adults 
without a history of major adverse clinical events.
Methods
Study design and participants
This cross-sectional investigation analyzed baseline data 
collected for a prospective cohort study. Briefly, a total of 
2560 asymptomatic participants with no history of CV 
and cerebrovascular disease, neurological abnormalities, 
or malignancy took part in baseline health examinations 
in the Seoul area between April 2010 and November 2012 
[11]. All participants were stratified into four groups 
based on Hb quartiles, as follows: ≤ 12.8 g/dL (group I), 
12.9–13.6  g/dL (group II), 13.7–14.5  g/dL (group III), 
and ≥ 14.6  g/dL (group IV). Hypertension was defined 
as a systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 140  mmHg and/
or a diastolic BP of ≥ 90  mmHg, or use of anti-hyper-
tensive medications. Hyperlipidemia was defined as a 
total cholesterol level of ≥ 240 mg/dL or treatment with 
lipid-lowering agents. Diabetes was defined as a fast-
ing glucose level of ≥ 126 mg/dL or use of anti-diabetic 
medications. MetS was defined as present when three 
or more of the following criteria were satisfied: (a) sys-
tolic B p ≥ 130  mmHg or diastolic B p ≥ 85  mmHg, or 
use of anti-hypertensive medications; (b) abdominal obe-
sity based on a waist circumference of ≥ 90  cm in men 
or ≥ 80 cm in women; (c) high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (HDL-C) level of < 40 mg/dL in men or < 50 mg/dL 
in women; (d) fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL; and (e) 
fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL or use of anti-diabetic medi-
cations [7].
Measurements
All blood samples were obtained after 8 h of fasting, and 
subsequently analyzed. Height and weight were meas-
ured with the participants wearing light clothing and no 
shoes. Body mass index was calculated as weight (kg) 
divided by the square of height  (m2). Carotid ultrasound 
was performed with a high-resolution B-mode ultra-
sonography system (Acuson X300; Siemens, USA) with a 
transducer frequency of 13–15 MHz. Computer-assisted 
acquisition, processing, B-mode image storage, and cal-
culation of intima-media thickness were performed 
using the Syngo Arterial Health Package (Siemens, USA). 
Automatic measurements of both common carotid arter-
ies were performed at the far wall of the 1-cm segment 
distal to the carotid bulbs. Carotid plaque was defined 
as the presence of focal wall thickening ≥ 50% than that 
of the surrounding vessel wall or as a focal region with a 
carotid intima-media thickness of ≥ 1.5 mm, protruding 
into the lumen and distinct from the neighboring bound-
ary [18, 19]. A representative image of a carotid plaque is 
presented in Fig. 1.

participants across the four groups were compared using 
one-way analysis of variance or the Kruskal–Wallis test 
for continuous variables, as appropriate. The χ2 test 
or Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables, 
as appropriate. As the comparison of the prevalence of 
MetS and carotid plaque was performed based on the 
lowest Hb quartile, the p-value cutoff for statistical sig-
nificance with Bonferroni correction was 0.017 for this 
analysis. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used 
to evaluate the association between clinical variables and 
the risk of carotid plaque. Multiple logistic regression 
models were used to evaluate the independent relation-
ship between Hb levels and the risk of carotid plaque. 
The forced-entry method was used to enter independent 
variables into multiple regression models. All statistical 
analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences software (version 19; SPSS, Chicago, 
IL, USA). A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant for all analyses.
Results
The baseline characteristics of the 2560 participants 
(mean age, 60 ± 8  years; 33% men) are presented in 
Table 1. The mean Hb levels were 12.2 ± 0.6, 13.3 ± 0.2, 
14.1 ± 0.3, and 15.5 ± 0.7 g/dL in group I, II, III, and IV, 
respectively. The prevalence of male sex, hypertension, 
and smoking steadily increased with increasing Hb level. 
The levels of triglyceride and fasting glucose increased, 
whereas HDL-C levels decreased with increasing Hb 
levels.
MetS was present in 952 (37.2%) participants. The 
prevalence of MetS was 27.4%, 35.9%, 42.6%, and 44.1% 
in groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Groups II, III, 
and IV showed a significantly higher prevalence of MetS 
than group I (Fig.  2a). Carotid plaque was observed 
in 856 (33.4%) participants. The prevalence of carotid 
plaque was 34.3%, 28.1%, 32.8%, and 39.5% in groups I, 
II, III, and IV, respectively. Only group II showed a sig-
nificantly lower prevalence of carotid plaque than group I 
(p = 0.014) (Fig. 2b). Carotid plaque was more frequently 
observed in participants with MetS than in those without 
MetS (39.8% vs. 29.7%, p < 0.001).
In the univariate logistic regression analysis, age 
(odds ratio [OR] 1.090, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.077–1.104), male sex (OR 1.826, 95% CI 1.538–
2.168), MetS (OR 1.568, 95% CI 1.326–1.856), and 
smoking (OR 1.995, 95% CI 1.667–2.388) were asso-
ciated with an increased risk of carotid plaque (all 
p < 0.01). Among the individual components of MetS, 
increased BP (OR 2.410, 95% CI 2.023–2.872, p < 0.001) 
and fasting glucose (OR 1.709, 95% CI 1.447–2.019, 
p < 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of 
carotid plaque. The risk of carotid plaque was signifi-
cantly lower in group II than in group I (OR 0.750, 95%

The results of multiple logistic regression models for 
the association of Hb with the risk of carotid plaque 
are presented in Table 3. Compared with group I, only 
group II was consistently associated with a decreased 
risk of carotid plaque in all logistic regression models.
Discussion
In the present cohort of relatively healthy adults with-
out a history of major adverse events, we investigated 
the beneficial range of Hb with respect to the risk of 
carotid plaque compared with the lowest category of 
Hb level, after adjusting for MetS and its individual 
components.

Low Hb level is a well-established risk factor for CV 
disease [20]. Furthermore, it is a substantial predictor 
of adverse clinical outcomes, independent of the CV 
risk status. Kalra et al. reported that a low Hb level was 
an independent predictor of mortality, CV events, and 
major bleeding in 21,829 patients with stable coronary 
artery disease [21]. Similar results have been reported 
in patients with acute coronary syndrome [1, 22, 23] and 
heart failure [24–26]. However, Tanne et  al. observed 
that the association between the Hb level on admission 
and mortality was not linear and the risk of mortal-
ity increased at both extremes of Hb levels in patients 
with acute stroke [4]. Zakai et al. demonstrated that low 
and high Hb levels were independently associated with 
increased mortality in a prospective cohort study with 
11.2 years of follow-up among 5888 community-dwelling 
men and women aged ≥ 65 years [5]. Kabat et al. showed 
a similar result in a large cohort of postmenopausal 
women [6]. Under conditions of high Hb levels, blood 
viscosity increases with elevated peripheral resistance 
and diminished cardiac output. An increase in blood vis-
cosity affects coronary, cerebral, and peripheral blood 
flow as well as perfusion [27–30]. In addition, high Hb 
levels could stimulate atherogenesis through erythrocyte 
aggregation, leading to platelet aggregation and adhesion 
to the arterial wall [30–32]. AMORIS (Apolipoprotein 
MOrtality RISk Study), a study in 114,159 healthy men 
and women by Holme et al., suggested that high Hb levels 
are a risk factor for major atherosclerotic CV events [33]. 
These results suggest that there may be a clinically bene-
ficial level of Hb even within the normal Hb range. How-
ever, there is a paucity of data on the association between 
serum Hb levels and the risk of subclinical atherosclero-
sis, especially in the healthy general population.
MetS is an important predictive factor for the devel-
opment of diabetes and atherosclerotic CV disease. 
Initially, we identified that (a) the prevalence of MetS 
steadily increased with increasing Hb level and (b) 
MetS was significantly associated with an increased risk 
of carotid plaque. Given the relevance of Hb to oxy-
gen-carrying capacity, oxidative stress, inflammatory 
processes, and blood viscosity, we hypothesized that a 
beneficial range of Hb for the risk of subclinical athero-
sclerosis compared with the lowest category of Hb level 
could be present in a relatively healthy adult popula-
tion. This study utilized carotid plaque as a subclinical 
atherosclerotic parameter because of its incremental 
value in predicting CV events irrespective of the base-
line CV risk status [15]. Interestingly, participants in 
group II were found to have a significantly lower risk 
of carotid plaque than those in group I after adjusting 
for MetS. Although the prevalence of carotid plaque in 
group IV was significantly higher than that in group III 
(39.5% vs. 32.8%, p = 0.017), no significant difference 
was observed between groups III and IV for the risk of 
carotid plaque after adjusting for MetS and its compo-
nents. Considering that data on the optimal levels of 
Hb for reducing the risk of subclinical atherosclerosis 
in primary prevention have been limited, our results 
could provide evidence for this issue in a relatively 
healthy adult population.
This study had some limitations. First, all participants 
voluntarily participated in a general health examina-
tion. Therefore, selection bias might be present. Second, 
the study population was restricted to Korean partici-
pants, which may limit generalization. Third, we could 
not evaluate the significance of anemia for the risk of 
carotid plaque because of the extremely low prevalence 
of anemia, as only 23 (0.9%) participants had serum Hb 
levels < 11.0 g/dL. This might be related to the fact that 
our study was performed in asymptomatic relatively 
healthy adults who had no history of major adverse clini-
cal events. Fourth, we did not perform subgroup analysis 
according to age categories and sex because the partici-
pants in this cohort study were relatively old and predom-
inantly women. Given the variability in the distribution of 
MetS and Hb according to sex (Additional file 1: Fig. 1), 
it might be better to stratify the data; however, stratifica-
tion was not feasible in the present study because of both 
the insufficient sample size and the skewed sex distribu-
tion. Further investigation with a larger sample size is 
necessary to identify the association of Hb with athero-
sclerosis, focusing on sex differences. Fifth, the design of 
this cohort study was cross-sectional. Thus, a longitudi-
nal assessment related to the impact of Hb on subclinical 
atherosclerosis is necessary. Sixth, despite the significant 
association between obstructive sleep apnea and serum 
Hb levels [34], we did not consider this issue because 
of the paucity of data from the cohort registry. Seventh, 
despite the well-established reproducibility of carotid 
plaque measurement [35], this study was conducted 
without checking the interobserver agreement of carotid 
plaque measurements. Finally, we did not evaluate other 
environmental risk factors and the potential roles of exer-
cise or diet in subclinical atherosclerosis. Despite these 
limitations, the present study is unique in that we iden-
tified the association of serum Hb level with the risk of 
subclinical atherosclerosis reflected in carotid plaque 
beyond MetS and its components in asymptomatic adults 
who had no history of major adverse clinical events.
Conclusions
Serum Hb level is significantly related to the risk of 
carotid plaque after adjusting for metabolic abnormali-
ties in relatively healthy Korean adults.
