Background
Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histologic
lesion with varied causes which include putative
circulating factor(s), monogenic etiologies and hyperfiltering
conditions [1, 2]. Monogenic FSGS has extensive
genetic heterogeneity with 59 implicated genes and the
list continues to expand, facilitated by the adoption of
next-generation sequencing technologies [3].
Defects in basement membrane proteins of the kidney
such as those encoded by type IV collagen and
LAMβ2 are amongst the monogenic causes of FSGS [1,
2]. Through broader sequencing efforts, reports over the
past several years have identified an under-recognition
of pathogenic variants in type IV collagen, causative for
Alport syndrome, in patients presenting with a range of
phenotypes spanning from non-progressive haematuria/
albuminuria, adult-onset FSGS and classic (severe) disease
[4–7]. The most abundant protein in the glomerular
based membrane (GBM) is heterotrimeric type IV collagen
(α3α4α5) but there exists numerous other proteins
that contribute to GBM architecture and turnover. Our
own local experience has highlighted a preponderance
of undiagnosed Alport syndrome but here we describe
an unexplained family with FSGS, where our detailed
genetic analysis identified an association with segregating
heterozygous variants in LAMA2 and LOXL4, whose
encoded proteins serve roles in basement membrane
assembly and function.
Methods
Patient ascertainment
Patients were recruited at University Health Network,
Toronto, ON, Canada after receiving informed consent
in accordance with the hospital Research Ethics Board.
We obtained longitudinal clinical data and eventually
blood, saliva, or isolated DNA. Clinical information was
obtained from telephone interviews, questionnaires and
physician reports. Genomic DNA was extracted from
blood or saliva samples using standard procedures.
Linkage analysis
Three affected individuals were genotyped with
HumanOmni2-5Exome-8-v1-1-A (2,583,651 markers)
while 8 samples were genotyped with InfiniumOmni2-
5Exome-8v1-3_A1 (2,612,357 markers). Parametric
multipoint linkage analysis was performed using Merlin
under a fully penetrant dominant model, with a disease
allele frequency of 0.0001 [8]. Starting with an original set
of 2,482,589 autosomal markers, several marker filtering
steps were performed including minor allele frequency
(MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) based marker filtering,
markers with MAF > 0.4 and those with pairwise
r2
< 0.1 on each chromosome were kept. This ultimately
resulted in a set of 11,335 markers across 22 autosomes
which were included in the linkage analyses. Since the
affection status of 3 out the 11 samples (7014, 7015 and
7824) was undetermined, linkage analysis was performed
on the pedigree 3 times taking into account each of the
three possible scenarios – (1) all 3 samples are affected,
(2) all are unaffected, and (3) all unknown. Results are
shown for scenario 3.
Exome capture and next‑generation sequencing
Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed by The
Centre for Applied Genomics, The Hospital for Sick
Children, Toronto, Canada. A shotgun library was made
from each sample and captured using the Agilent Sure-
Select Human All Exon V5 (Santa Clara, CA) according
to protocol. The manufacturer’s specifications state that
the capture regions total approximately ≈180,000 exons
from ≈18,700 genes or 54 Mb. Enriched libraries were
then sequenced by 150 bp, paired-end read sequencing
on Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA).
In silico data processing
Reads were mapped to the hg19 reference sequence
using the BWA-backtrack algorithm from BWA v0.5.9
[9]. Duplicate reads were removed using MarkDuplicates
from Picard v1.79. Local read realignment around
insertions and deletions (indels), base quality score
recalibration, and variant calling with UnifiedGenotyper,
were accomplished using GATK v1.1–28 [10,
11]. SNP calls were subjected to variant quality score
recalibration. Indels were discarded if they overlapped
repeat masked regions, and hard-filtered by variant
call annotations QualByDepth (QD < 10.0), ReadPos-
RankSumTest (ReadPosRankSum < -20.0), and Strand
Bias (SB > -0.01). Base calling was performed using
CASAVA v1.8.2. Copy number variants (CNVs) were
identified using XHMM after filtering out regions with
extreme GC-content and repeat-masked regions [12,
13].
Basement membrane measurements
Distances were measured in Fiji/ImageJ using a grid
method to obtain a minimum of 100 measurement per
individual normalised to the length of the GBM [14].
The total number of measurements for each individual
were: 6237: n = 177; 6238: n = 160; 6463: n = 210; 7825:
n = 359. The mean ± SEM was calculated and a oneway
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test
was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3 for
Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California
USA, www. graph pad. com.
Results
The proband, 6238, presented with proteinuria in
his early 20s, with protein excretion rising to up to
8 g/day, and a kidney biopsy at age 41 demonstrated
FSGS (Figs. 1 and 2). Additionally, focally duplicated
and irregular thickening of the GBM along with focal
effacement of podocyte foot processes was observed.
His brothers (7825, 6237) were shown to have FSGS
in the 4th
and 5th
decades of life. The proband and his
elder brother, 7825, developed end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD) in the 5th
decade of life while the youngest
brother, 6237, has stage 3b A3 CKD at age 59. One
sister, 6464, developed proteinuria and impaired kidney
function at the time of last follow-up at age 54. Her
daughter, 6463, who was found to have FSGS at age
23, had ~ 3.3 g/d of proteinuria and an eGFR of 48 mL/
min/1.73m2 at age 30. Two of the proband’s sisters,
7014 and 7015, were reported to have proteinuria and
no renal biopsies by the 5th
decade of life. The proband’s
mother was reported to have FSGS, developing ESKD
at age 68. The proband’s son, 7824, was described to
have proteinuria. 7827 has not had recent screening in
his 30s. There was no reported history of hematuria in
any of the family members.
Six hundred and twenty-five genes associated with
nephropathy, including 59 FSGS, were examined in the
family with no segregating rare variants identified [6].
Of note, pathogenic variants causing medullary cystic
kidney disease type 1 may lie in a variable-number tandem
repeat (VNTR) sequence in MUC1 and is missed by
massively parallel sequencing [15]. However, in this family,
the index of suspicion is low for MUC1-associated
disease given the clinical characteristics consistent with
a primary glomerular disorder as evidence by > 3 g/day of
protein excretion and supported by pathologic findings
rather than a primary tubulointerstitial process [16].
Genotype data from 11 individuals of this European
descent pedigree was analyzed for multipoint linkage
analysis, which included a set of 11,335 SNPs across autosomes.
The segregation of the disease in the pedigree was
not compatible with X-linked disease and therefore only
autosomal linkage analysis was performed under a fully
penetrant dominant model, with the affection status of
5 individuals as affected (6237, 6238, 6463, 6464, 7825),
3 individuals as unaffected (7826, 7827, 7828) and 3 as
unknown (7014, 7015, 7824). The maximum LOD score
was 0.9028, and it was observed at 388 markers across 11
different chromosomes (chromosome 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10,
12, 13 and 18), narrowing the candidate gene(s) to only
3% (388 SNPs/11,335 SNPs) of the genome (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Copy number variants (CNV) were also analyzed
but there was no co-segregation of any particular
CNV in all affected individuals of the family.
Whole exome sequencing was performed in 6237,
6238 and 6463, identifying 5 heterozygous rare variants
(minor allele frequency or MAF < 0.01) in the
linked regions (Fig. 1). Sanger sequencing of the 5
variants in 11 individuals where DNA was available
identified 2 of these to be segregating in all affected individuals,
while the other 3 did not (Fig. 1). This included
the variants in LAMA2 (chr6, NM_000426.3:c.380A > G
(p.Thr127Ala); MAF 1.76 × 10–
5) and LOXL4 (chr10,
NM_0002211:c.1684_1686del (p.Glu562del); MAF
3.871 × 10–
5), which affected amino acid residues
that were found to be highly conserved across species
(Fig. 1). MAFs were determined by gnomAD v.2.1.1,
which contains 125,748 exome sequences and 15,708
whole-genome sequences. Both variants were predicted
to be deleterious by in silico programs (Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2).
LAMA2 contributes to laminin networks and localizes
to the mesangium while LOXL4 catalyzes cross
linking of collagens and is expressed in glomeruli and
tubules. Detailed examination of electron microscopy
of basement membranes was undertaken in 4 individuals:
6237, 6238, 6463 and 7825. In 6237, regions of dense
mesangial matrix were observed (Fig. 2) but this was not
observed in other biopsies of the same individual or the
3 other individuals. The glomerular basement membrane
(GBM) thickness was also compared. The average GBM
widths (± SEM) were: 574.3 nm ± 11.8 (6237; male),
345.7 nm ± 8.1 (6238; male), 375.6 nm ± 8.5 (7825; male),
495.9 ± 7.2 (all individuals) (Fig. 2). Two of these patients,
6237 and 7825, had wider GBMs than historic control
averages (male 373 ± 42 nm, n = 59 male kidney donors;
and 326 ± 45 nm, n = 59 female kidney donors) [17].
Discussion and conclusions
Our comprehensive genetic analysis in this FSGS family
consisting of linkage analysis narrowed candidates to 3%
(388 SNPs/11,335 SNPs) of the genome. Whole exome
sequencing subsequently identified segregating rare variants
in LAMA2 and LOXL4 as candidate disease genes.
Laminins are found in an intricate lattice of proteins
that compose extracellular matrices of organs. LAMA2
encodes the laminin alpha-2 subunit. In the glomerulus,
it heterotrimerizes with laminin beta-1 or 2 (LAMβ1,
LAMβ2) and laminin gamma-1 (LAMC1), called laminin
211 or 221, to form the mesangial extracellular matrix
[18, 19]. The variant LAMA2 T127A exists in the laminin
N-terminal (LN) domain, which is responsible for trimertrimer
interaction of laminin polymer formation involved
in the initiation of basement membrane assembly [20].
Certain variants in LAMA2 have reported to cause
LAMA2-muscular dystrophy, an autosomal recessive
disorder caused by loss of laminin-211 in skeletal muscle
[21]. None of the affected family members had evidence
of LAMA2-muscular dystrophy. Lama2 protein is also
expressed in most tubular segments with the exception of
proximal tubules (https:// esbl. nhlbi. nih. gov/ KTEA/) (22).
LOXL4 encodes an amine oxidase enzyme that is copper
dependent and hypothesized to catalyze the cross
linking of collagens and elastins [23]. It is expressed in
both glomeruli and tubules (https:// www. prote inatl as.
org/ ENSG0 00001 38131- LOXL4/ tissue/ kidney; https://
gtexp ortal. org/ home/ gene/ LOXL4; https:// esbl. nhlbi. nih.
gov/ KTEA/) (22). The single amino acid deletion occurs at
the C-terminus of the protein, which is highly conserved.
Segregation analysis was performed and deemed not
to segregate if not found in an affected individual. However,
an unaffected or unknown status individual could
have the variant and still satisfy segregation analysis due
to reasons of incomplete penetrance or later onset of
disease. In this family, ESKD occurs in the 5th
to 6th
decade
of life and some of the female relatives have milder
disease.
We designate LAMA2 and LOXL4 as candidate FSGS
genes due to several study limitations. These include the
absence of rigorous functional characterization to support
pathogenicity, which is challenging for matrix proteins.
Instead we provide renal pathology correlations,
demonstrating GBM and mesangial matrix thickening
in 3 affected relatives. Alternatively, identification of
additional FSGS cases with suspected deleterious variants
in LAMA2 and LOXL4 will provide more evidence
for disease causality. Thus, our report will be of interest
to clinicians and genetic groups as sequencing in renal
disease becomes more widespread. Though the LAMA2
and LOXL4 variants are rare, they are not absent in gnomAD
v.2.1.1 but phenotypic data is not available for correlation.
However, it is unlikely that these 2 rare variants
exist in the same individuals but this is impossible to
ascertain based on the summary data that is available in
gnomAD. Another limitation is our use of whole exome
sequencing, which may not adequately capture some
regions and only evaluates coding but not intronic or
intergenic sequence.
Based on our findings, we narrow candidates to 3%
of the genome and identify coding sequence variants in
LAMA2 and LOXL4, which have biologic plausibility, as
candidates for disease causation in a family with FSGS.
We postulate that the additive effect of digenic inheritance
of heterozygous variants in LAMA2 and LOXL4
leads to late adult-onset disease in the affected relatives.
We further postulate that the absence of clinically significant
extra-kidney features including muscular dystrophy
is as a result of the impact of the variant (heterozygous
missense for LAMA2, heterozygous single base pair deletion
in LOXL4), which should lead to translated protein
rather than complete deficiency that can be seen in autosomal
recessive disorders like LAMA2-muscular dystrophy.
Our report will thus be of benefit to the renal
community as sequencing in disease becomes more
widely applied should more candidate variants in these
genes be discovered.
