Background
Esophageal cancer ranks seventh in terms of incidence
and sixth in mortality overall according to the
report of the 2018 Global Cancer Statistics [1]. In
China, esophageal cancer is the sixth most frequent
malignant tumor and the fourth leading cause of
cancer-related death [2]. Esophageal adenocarcinoma
(EADC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(ESCC) are the two most common histologic subtypes
of esophageal cancer [3]. In high-income countries,
majority of the esophageal cancer patients have
EADCs. In China, more than 90% of the esophageal
cancer cases are ESCCs [4]. The most studied region
of China is located in the North Central Taihang
Mountain. In this area, ESCC is the leading cause of
death [5]. Based on a recent report from this region,
esophageal cancer prognosis is poor and the 5-year
survival rates are about 30% [6].
Esophagitis is usually a benign disease. However, it is
associated with an elevated risk for subsequent ESCC.
Based on the WHO tumor classification, endoscopic biopsy
of precancerous lesions yield low-grade intraepithelial
neoplasia (LGIN) or high-grade intraepithelial
neoplasia (HGIN) [7]. A report using a sample of containing
both lesion types reported a 74% risk for esophageal
cancer [8]. Identification of precursor lesions is
critical for clinical care because these precursor lesions
are curable. Early identification can reduce or delay
ESCC mortality [9]. Overall, epidemiologic studies of
ESCC show that it is population-dependent. The multifactorial
basis for ESCC includes environmental exposures,
lifestyle factors, and genetic traits [10]. In Western
countries, alcohol consumption and smoking are the
major risk factors for ESCC leading to a sevenfold increased
risk of disease for smokers [11]. In high-risk
areas of China, tobacco or alcohol does not appear to
play the same role in population level rates of ESCC
[12, 13]. Epidemiologic studies in these areas have
not identified alternatives to smoking and alcohol
consumption to explain these high rates of ESCC
[14]. By increasing the number of cases of different
esophageal lesions, this report presents evidence to
improve our understanding of population-level factors
in high rate areas of China.
To fill the gap in our understanding of risk factors at
different stages of esophageal lesions - esophagitis, LGIN
and HGIN - this report presents cross-sectional data
from five high-incidence regions of ESCC in China.
Methods
Study population
This was a multicenter cross-sectional study, which relies
on the high incidence regions of esophageal, gastric
and colorectal cancer established by the cancer early
diagnosis and early treatment project in China [15]. In
2017, we launched a new screening study of upper
gastrointestinal cancer in five high-risk regions of upper
gastrointestinal cancer in China, including Hebei,
Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Gansu Provinces. The
main purpose of this project is to identify the high-risk
population of malignant upper gastrointestinal cancer
and to establish a cancer risk prediction model to provide
support for the prevention of upper gastrointestinal
cancer.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) local permanent
residents in selected regions, (2) no history of
endoscopic examination during the last 3 years, (3) no
history of cancer, mental disorder, or any contraindication
for endoscopy, (4) signed informed consent, and (5)
agreement to complete all survey and examination, including
endoscopy. The participant selection process is
shown in Fig. 1. We recruited participants from April
2017 to December 2018. The final analysis included
44,857 residents aged 40–69 years. Among these participants,
there were 116 invasive ESCC cases, 321 HGIN
cases, 1874 LGIN cases, 4890 esophagitis cases, and
37,656 normal esophagus controls.
The study was approved by the Capital Medical University,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking
Union Medical College. All the experiment
protocol for involving humans was in accordance to
guidelines of Declaration of Helsinki. The STROBE
statement can be found in Additional File 1.
Survey and measurement
Comprehensive questionnaire information was collected
by face-to-face interviews and entered directly into a laptop
based data entry system by trained investigators.
The data entry process was facilitated with software designed
to decrease missing items and reduce logic inaccuracy.
A full questionnaire commonly took 35 ~ 45
min to accomplish. Items in the survey included demographic
characteristics (e.g. gender, age), socio-economic
status (e.g. occupation, education and income), lifestyle
habits (e.g. smoking, alcohol and tea drinking), eating
habits (e.g. fresh fruit, meat and milk), history of diseases
(e.g. history of chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis), as well as
medical history (e.g. acid suppressant medications and
antibiotics). In this study, occupation and education level
were also classified two categories: farmer/non-farmer
and formal/no formal. In addition, frequency of consumption
of specific dietary components was collected
using an item with a five-level response category. The
responses included: eating every day, 4–6 days per week,
1–3 days per week, 1–3 days per month and never eating.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by the formula:
weight (kg)/height (m2) and then classified as
underweight if BMI < 18.5 kg/m2, normal if between
18.5 kg/m2 and 23.9 kg/m2, overweight if between 24.0
kg/m2 and 27.9 kg/m2, and obese if BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/m2 according
to the Chinese population recommendation
[16]. The detailed definitions of the variables were
shown in Additional File 2.
The endoscopic examinations were conducted by physicians
at local hospitals. Procedures were based on clinical
guidelines for cancer screening and early diagnosis
and treatment in China [17]. The whole esophagus was
visually examined. Lugol’ iodine staining in esophagus
was applied to the diagnosis of suspicious lesions. The
subjects with suspicious lesions (unstained and inflammatory
lesions) were needed biopsy. The number of biopsies
depended on the size of the lesion (> 1 cm, ≥ 2
biopsy; > 2 cm, ≥ 3 biopsy; > 3 cm, ≥ 4 biopsy). In
addition, if multiple scattered lesions were found, biopsy
of all suspicious lesions should be taken as much as possible.
Subjects without suspicious lesions did not receive
a biopsy. The biopsy slides were read by two pathologists
independently. If there were any inconsistencies, a third
pathologist would give advice through discussion. Doctors
reported the worst biopsy diagnosis to participants
with multiple lesions. The histological criteria were as
previously described [18–20].
To ascertain severity, esophageal mucosa was ranked
using 5 categories: normal esophageal mucosa, minor
mucosa changes, esophagitis, esophageal squamous simple
hyperplasia (ESSH) or esophageal squamous dysplasia
(ESD) [21]. ESD was further categorized into 3 levels
including mild, moderate, and severe. According to
WHO tumor histological classification [7], mild and
moderate ESD combined fall under LGIN. Severe ESD
and squamous cell carcinoma in situ (CIS) are considered
as the HGIN. In this study, we grouped the participants
into 4 groups: normal control, esophagitis, LGIN
and HGIN/ESCC (lesions including severe ESD, CIS,
and higher-grade lesions).
Statistical analyses
Basic, descriptive statistics show categorical variables as
frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables
are shown as mean and standard deviations. The appropriate
tests for significance were applied, χ2 or ANOVA
test, respectively. In this report, we use the unconditional
univariable logistic model to calculate crude odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) [22].
The variables with a P value ≤0.2 in unconditional univariable
logistic analysis were selected for unconditional
multivariable logistic analysis. We considered three
models to calculate the adjusted OR, including ageadjusted
only, gender-adjusted only and adjusted age,
gender, education, BMI and income at the same time.
These adjusted confounders were selected based on the
previous studies of esophageal cancer. Besides, models of
adjustment for age or gender only were conducted as
they may influence the socioeconomic status. In this
study, dependent variable was the diagnosis outcome of
disease. The independent variables included environment,
lifestyle, diet habits, and medical history. We used
SPSS software (version 24.0) to perform χ2 or ANOVA
test, and glm function of R software (version 3.6.1) to
perform logistic regression analysis. All tests of significance
were two-sided with a P value of 0.05 was considered
as statistically significant, expect univariable logistic
regression analysis.
Results
Participant characteristics
A total of 44,857 subjects aged 40 to 69 were incorporated
in the analysis, including 37,656 (83.95%) subjects
with a normal esophagus, 4890 (10.90%) people with
esophagitis, 1874 (4.18%) cases of LGIN and 437 (0.97%)
cases of HGIN/ESCC. Because the complete statistical
description table was too long (Additional File 3), we
only selected a few main variables to show in Table 1.
The proportion of male in normal group, esophagitis,
LGIN and HGIN/ESCC was 41.4, 46.8, 48.7 and 56.5%,
respectively. However, the normal group (54.41 ± 7.26)
was composed of a slightly younger population than the
esophagitis (57.29 ± 6.85), LGIN (59.22 ± 6.25) and
HGIN/ESCC (60.85 ± 5.80) group.
Risk factors for different esophageal lesions
We applied two steps to identify risk factors. Firstly, the
unconditional univariable logistic regression analysis was
used to test each variable independently and the estimated
ORs with 95%CI are listed in Additional File 4.
Secondly, the statistically significant variables in unconditional
univariable logistic analysis were selected for unconditional
multivariable analysis and the results were
shown in Additional File 5. Tables 2, 3, 4 displayed the
significant factors of 3 lesion groups from unconditional
univariable logistic analysis and multivariable logistic
analysis adjusted for age, gender, education, BMI and
income.
After final unconditional multivariable analysis, we
identified a few important risk factors of 3 esophageal lesions.
For the HGIN/ESCC patients, some unhealthy
lifestyle and dietary habits (Table 3) were risk factors, including
alcohol (adjusted OR 1.60, 95%CI 1.23–2.09),
smoking (adjusted OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.14–1.89), drinking
well and surface water (adjusted OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.28–
1.89), salty diet (adjusted OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.07–1.77),
drinking tea (adjusted OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.08–1.61). Although
the P value of drinking hot/burning hot tea was
no statistically significant, the adjusted OR value was
1.34. In addition, pesticide exposure (adjusted OR 1.44,
95% CI 1.11–1.84), loose teeth (adjusted OR 1.48, 95%CI
0.99–2.12), history of chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis (adjusted
OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.03–3.22), and family history of
cancer (adjusted OR 1.64, 95%CI 1.34–2.00), also positively
related to the risk of HGIN/ESCC (Tables 2, 3, 4).
Based on the results of the adjusted analysis, we also
found that some risk factors associated with LGIN were
the same as HGIN/ESCC, consisting of drinking alcohol
(adjusted OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.12–1.51), drinking well and
surface water (adjusted OR 1.19, 95%CI 1.08–1.32), salty
diet (adjusted OR 1.57, 95%CI 1.38–1.81), drinking tea
(adjusted OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.26–1.54), family history of
cancer (adjusted OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.20–1.47), pesticide
exposure (adjusted OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.05–1.37) and loose
teeth (adjusted OR 1.23, 95%CI 1.00–1.51). In addition,
occupation as a farmer (adjusted OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.07–
1.35) was also positively related to the risk of LGIN
(Table 3). Drinking hot tea still did not find statistical
significance (adjusted OR 1.10, 95%CI 0.92–1.33). On
the contrary, eating poultry meat (adjusted OR 0.73,
95%CI 0.66–0.81), fruits (adjusted OR 0.89, 95%CI 0.80–
0.98), vitamins (adjusted OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.27–0.82),
milk (adjusted OR 0.82, 95%CI 0.71–0.94), acid suppressants
(adjusted OR 0.51, 95%CI 0.39–0.66), antibiotics
(adjusted OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.14–0.80) and drinking improved
water (adjusted OR 0.58, 95%CI 0.46–0.72) were
negatively related to the risk of LGIN.
Although esophagitis is a benign disease, there are
more risk elevating and risk reduction factors than the
diseases mentioned above. For the diet habits (Table 3),
except that leftovers (adjusted OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.40–
1.58) and salty diet (adjusted OR 1.57, 95%CI 1.45–1.71)
were risk factors, the remaining factors had protective
effect on esophagitis, such as poultry meat (adjusted OR
0.62, 95%CI 0.58–0.67), fruits (adjusted OR 0.83, 95%CI
0.78–0.88), vitamins (adjusted OR 0.68, 95%CI 0.50–
0.90), livestock meat (adjusted OR 0.88, 95%CI 0.81–
0.95), seafood (adjusted OR 0.89, 95%CI 0.82–0.97),
spring onion/ginger/garlic (adjusted OR 0.69, 95%CI
0.65–0.74) and nuts (adjusted OR 0.77, 95%CI 0.71–
0.84).
In addition, some unhealthy lifestyles were positively
related to the risk of esophagitis (Table 3), including
smoking (adjusted OR 1.09, 95%CI 1.00–1.19), drinking
well and surface water (adjusted OR 1.61, 95%CI 1.51–
1.71), and having snore (adjusted OR 1.09, 95%CI 1.02–
1.15). On the contrary, other healthy lifestyles were
negatively related to the risk of esophagitis (Table 3), including
drinking improved water (adjusted OR 0.73,
95%CI 0.64–0.83), refrigerator use (adjusted OR 0.50–
0.73, P < 0.001), physical exercise (adjusted OR 0.69,
95%CI 0.62–0.76) and doing housework (adjusted OR
0.57–0.63, P < 0.001). Except for foods and lifestyles,
family history of cancer (adjusted OR 1.22, 95%CI 1.14–
1.30), history of chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis (adjusted OR
2.96, 95%CI 2.52–3.47), occupation as a farmer (adjusted
OR 1.21, 95%CI 1.12–1.30) and missing teeth (adjusted
OR 1.14–1.94, P < 0.01) were positively related to the
risk of esophagitis (Tables 2, 3, 4). Taking acid suppressants
(adjusted OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.60–0.80) and taking
antibiotics every day (adjusted OR 0.40, 95%CI 0.24–
0.65) were negatively related to the risk of esophagitis
(Table 4).
Discussion
The high rate of early esophageal lesions progressing to
esophageal cancer has resulted in a concerted attempt to
better understand the risk factors associated with this
difference. In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional
study in five areas with high incidence of ESCC in
China, aiming to recognize the risk factors related to different
esophageal lesions. At last, we identified three important
risk factors, which persisted across all stages.
Otherwise, we also find that the key risk factors in different
stages were various.
The three common risk factors are drinking well and
surface water, salty diet, and family history of cancer. At
present, the main sources of drinking water for some
local residents in rural area of high incidence region
were still well and surface water. Since the 1980s, the
local government has taken significant measures to improve
the quality of drinking water, and the incidence
and mortality of esophageal cancer displayed a decreasing
trend compared with regions where no improvement
[23]. Our result showed that drinking well and surface
water was important risk factor from early stage to late
stage of lesions. We advised that the water improvement
project still needed to implement in rural regions with
poor drinking water quality.
Previous studies found local people of rural areas were
inclined to eat salty foods, such as salted meat, salted
duck eggs and pickled vegetables. Both high frequency
and long-term intakes were associated with elevated risk
of ESCC. This observation is consistent with other studies
[16, 24, 25]. However, the underlying mechanism was
still unclear. We speculate that the mechanism, possible
similar to gastric cancer [26, 27], is that high salt concentrations
disrupt the mucosal barrier and lead to inflammation,
which could increase the possibility of
bacterial infection. It is noticed that salty diet, an important
risk factor, existed at all stages of early esophageal
lesions in our study.
The association between ESCC and family history of
cancer had been reported. Some studies showed that
family history of cancer was strongly associated with
ESCC risk and that genetic factors could contribute to
the effect [28, 29]. Based on our results, we suggest that
the above three common risk factors should be considered
first in prevention of all stages.
History of chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis, pesticides exposure
and alcohol were important risk factors for esophagitis,
LGIN and HGIN/ESCC, respectively. China has a
high burden of liver disease [30, 31], previous studies report
that chronic liver diseases, in particular chronic
hepatitis B virus infection, are associated with reflux
esophagitis reflux [32, 33]. In this study, we identified
that history of chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis was the tremendous
risk factor both esophagitis and HGIN/ESCC.
Currently, there is an effective vaccine to prevent hepatitis
B virus infection. Increased vaccination for hepatitis
B could also reduce the occurrence of ESCC in high incidence
regions. Similar to our findings, previous studies
had confirmed that alcohol is a risk factor for ESCC [4,
10]. The reason is that acetaldehyde, a class 1 carcinogen,
is the first metabolite of ethanol metabolism [34,
35].
Pesticides had been reported as a risk factor for a variety
of cancers [36], such as prostate cancer [37] and
childhood leukemia [38], but the role of pesticides in
esophageal cancer is still unclear. Our results showed
that pesticide exposure was an important risk factor,
which not only increased the risk of LGIN (adjusted OR
1.20, 95%CI 1.05–1.37) but also HGIN/ESCC (adjusted
OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.11–1.84). In this study, most of participants
are farmer, who had a greater chance exposed
pesticide than non-farmer, which could increase the risk
of early esophageal lesions. Therefore, the result showed
that pesticide was a significant risk factor of LGIN and
HGIN/ESCC. Further study is needed to evaluate the
mechanism linking pesticide exposure and early esophageal
lesions.
It is noticed that our study found that high frequency
of drinking tea is a risk factor for LGIN and LGIN/
ESCC, which is similar to previous study [39]. Currently,
the association between tea consumption and esophageal
cancer is inconsistent, which could be related to the type
of tea [40]. In addition, our research found that although
adjusted OR values were all greater than 1, there was no
statistically significant correlation between high tea
temperature and different esophageal lesions. This result
could be caused by the small sample size of cases. Further
prospective study is still needed. Interestingly, our
results revealed that antibiotics were protective factor
for esophagitis and LGIN. Previous study found that
Porphyromonas gingivalis was positively correlated with
the severity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and
might contribute to the pathogenesis of esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma [41]. We speculated that antibiotics
intake might change the composition of the gut
microbiome and reduce their adverse effects on esophagus,
thus play a positive role in the prevention of ESCC.
Besides, we also found that with the aggravation of the
esophageal lesions, the number of risk factors reduced,
which suggested that the effect of environmental factors
on the late stage of the disease decreased. These results
also mean that it is a more meaningful method for prevention
of ESCC by controlling environmental factors in
early lesion, such as balanced diet, proper exercise, and
healthy lifestyle.
The present study had several limitations. Most of the
variables analyzed in the study were based on selfreported
data which may be susceptible to recall bias. In
addition, there are some factors were not collected in
the questionnaire, such as cooking methods, history of
upper gastrointestinal tumors or esophageal cancer. The
main strength of our study is that it was the first multicenter
cross-sectional study to identify risk factors in different
stage of early esophageal lesions. Furthermore,
detailed questionnaire was collected in a standardized
data entry system by trained investigator to assure the
quality of the data. In addition, we used the gold standard
method to exam esophageal lesions.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we performed a cross sectional study of
44,857 individuals in the age range of 40–69 years. These
individuals live in regions with high-rates of ESCC regions
in China. This report has identified drinking well
and surface water, salty diet, family history of cancer and
alcohol consumption as factors influencing disease rates
across all stages. We also identified history of chronic
hepatitis/cirrhosis and pesticide exposure as essential
risk factors in esophagitis, LGIN and HGIN/ESCC, respectively.
The results make a compelling case for environmental
factors being the main driver of disease. The
results also suggest directions for efforts to ESCC in an
early stage of disease in high incidence regions. However,
considering the complexity of the disease, although
environmental factors play an important role in the early
stages of ESCC, these may vary as the severity of the disease
increases. Further cohort studies are needed to support and expand our understanding of ESCC risk
factors.
