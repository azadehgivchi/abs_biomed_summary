Background
Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) belongs
to the biguanide class of drugs and is a widely used
drug administered orally to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus
[1]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that metformin
use is associated with decreased cancer incidence
and mortality in patients with diabetes [2, 3]. Furthermore,
accumulating evidence suggests that metformin
exerts antitumour effects in many cancers [4–6]. However,
the underlying molecular mechanism by which
metformin reduces tumour incidence and inhibits cancer
cell growth in vitro and in vivo has not been clearly elucidated.
The well-accepted mechanism of metformin action
is inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I
and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
in response to energy depletion [7]. AMPK is a heterodimeric
protein complex that plays an essential role in
sensing energy and suppressing cell growth under lowenergy
conditions [8]. Activated AMPK phosphorylates
multiple downstream targets to maintain cellular energy
homeostasis [8, 9].
One of the central downstream targets inhibited by
AMPK is mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1), a serine/threonine kinase that has a critical
role in controlling cell growth and cellular metabolism
by integrating various environmental signals, such as
growth factors, amino acids, and glucose [10, 11].
mTORC1 directly phosphorylates downstream substrates,
including ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1
(4E-BP1), to regulate protein synthesis to promote cell
proliferation [12]. mTORC1 is tightly regulated by multiple
upstream pathways. The response of mTORC1 signalling
to growth factors is mediated by the small
GTPase Ras homology enriched in brain (Rheb), which
is negatively regulated by tuberous sclerosis complex
(TSC1/2) proteins [13–15]. When the PI3K/Akt pathway
is activated by growth factors, Akt phosphorylates TSC2
and disrupts the TSC1/2 complex [16, 17]. Energy levels
signal to mTORC1 through AMPK by two mechanisms
[18]. Firstly, AMPK directly phosphorylates the TSC2 on
S1387 to activate TSC2 and promote inhibition of
mTORC1 inhibition through the Rheb axis [19, 20]. The
second, AMPK phosphorylates raptor on serines 722
and 792 to directly inhibit mTORC1 activity [21]. Some
studies have reported that metformin inhibits the
mTORC1 signalling pathway independent of AMPK activation
[22–24]. However, the molecular mechanisms
involved in AMPK-independent mTORC1 inhibition by
metformin have not been fully elucidated.
In the present study, we investigated the molecular
mechanism(s) by which metformin induces mTORC1
inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.
We found that inhibition of mTORC1 in response to
metformin requires ATF4 and that ATF4-induced upregulation
of REDD1 and Sestrin2 is implicated in this
effect. REDD1 and Sestrin2 are necessary for mTORC1
inhibition by metformin treatment, and the response occurs
through an ATF4-dependent mechanism in NSCLC
cells. In conclusion, ATF4-induced REDD1 and Sestrin2
expression triggered by metformin plays an important role
in mTORC1 inhibition independent of AMPK activation.
Methods
Cell culture and reagents
H1299 NSCLC cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas,
VA, USA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(#LM011–01; Welgene, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of
Korea) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum

Metformin, phenformin and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was assessed by measuring the mitochondrial
conversion of MTT. The proportion of converted
MTT was calculated by measuring the absorbance at
570 nm. The results are expressed as the percentage
reduction in MTT under the assumption that the absorbance
of the control cells was 100%. The MTT experiments
were repeated three times.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR)
RNA was isolated from H1299 cells using TRIzol Reagent

Sestrin2 (assay ID: Hs00230241_m1), and Sestrin3 (assay
ID: Hs00914870_m1). β-actin (assay ID: Hs01060665_
g1) was used as an internal control. Quantitative realtime
PCR was performed using an ABI 7500 Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The fold change in
gene expression was determined using the comparative
CT (2–ΔΔCT) method.
Transient transfection
ATF4 (#sc-35,112), REDD1 (#sc-45,806), Sestrin2 (sc-106,
544) and control (#sc-37,007) siRNAs were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA). siRNA
transfections in H1299 cells were performed using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Western blot analysis
Proteins from cell lysates were separated using 6–11%
sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes followed by immunoblotting
with the specified primary and
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
The following antibodies were used: S6K (#9202), p-S6K
(Thr389) (#9205), 4E-BP1 (#9644), ACC (#3662), p-ACC

1-AP), Sestrin1 (#21668–1-AP), Sestrin2 (#10795–1-AP),
and Sestrin3 (#11431–2-AP) antibodies were obtained
from the Proteintech Group (Chicago, IL, USA), and the
β-actin (#A5316) antibody was obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich (Merck KGaA).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD)
of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was
performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by
Tukey’s post hoc test with the GraphPad Prism software
(Version 5.0; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA). P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001 were considered to
indicate statistically significant results.
Results
Metformin induces mTORC1 inhibition through AMPK
activation
We first investigated the impact of metformin on
mTORC1 activity in NSCLC cells. H1299 cells were
treated with metformin at the above mentioned concentrations
for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, metformin inhibited
mTORC1 activity, as shown by the decrease in S6K
phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was decreased
by metformin, as evidenced by a shift to fastermigrating
species [25]. Phenformin, a metformin
analogue also inhibited mTORC1 activity, as assessed by
reduced phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1. It has
been reported that metformin requires AMPK to inhibit
mTORC1 [26]. As expected, metformin and phenformin
both induced AMPK activation, as evaluated by the activating
phosphorylation of Thr172 in AMPKα and Ser79
in the AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)
(Fig. 1A). Next, we explored the effect of the absence of
AMPK on metformin-induced mTORC1 inhibition.
AMPKα siRNA abrogated AMPKα expression and prevented
ACC phosphorylation induced by metformin treatment
(Fig. 1B). The metformin-induced decrease in phfv.
osphorylated S6K was restored by knockdown of
AMPKα (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that AMPK activation
contributes to mTORC1 inhibition in response to
metformin.
Metformin induces mTORC1 inhibition through ATF4
It has been reported that metformin can also inhibit
mTORC1 through an AMPK-independent pathway [22–
24]. Since activation of the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 axis was
triggered by metformin [27], we investigated whether
ATF4 is involved in metformin-induced mTORC1 inhibition.
Metformin induced ATF4 protein expression but
did not affect the induction of ATF4 mRNA (Fig. 2A-D).
The metformin-induced decrease in phosphorylated S6K
was restored by knockdown of ATF4 (Fig. 2E and F),
suggesting that ATF4 is necessary for metforminmediated
inhibition of mTORC1.
REDD1 and Sestrin2 expression in the presence of
metformin is regulated by ATF4
We previously reported that ATF4 facilitates the transcription
of the REDD1 gene [28]. Thus, we investigated
whether REDD1 expression is upregulated by
metformin-induced ATF4 activation. Metformin and
phenformin both induced REDD1 protein and mRNA
expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and B).
ATF4 siRNA almost completely blocked the upregulation
of REDD1 in the presence of metformin (Fig. 3C
and D). Sestrins are stress-inducible proteins that regulate
metabolic homeostasis [29]. We investigated
whether Sestrins are upregulated by metformin or phenformin.
As shown in Fig. 3E and F, Sestrin2 protein and
mRNA levels were upregulated under metformin or
phenformin treatment. However, metformin and phenformin
had no impact on the gene or protein expression
of Sestrin1 or Sestrin3. We further investigated whether
ATF4 is responsible for the upregulation of Sestrin2 expression
in response to metformin. H1299 cells were
transfected with ATF4 siRNA and treated with
metformin. ATF4 siRNA blocked the upregulation of
Sestrin2 in response to metformin (Fig. 3C and D).
These data suggest that ATF4 activation is important for
the induction of REDD1 and Sestrin2 expression by metformin
treatment.
AMPK and ATF4 do not affect each other’s expression in
the presence of metformin
We investigated whether AMPK and ATF4 affect each
other’s expression in the presence of metformin. We
first investigated the protein expression of ATF4 and its
downstream targets REDD1 and Sestrin2 by treatment
with metformin in AMPK knockdown cells. The downregulation
of AMPKα did not alter the induction of
ATF4, REDD1 or Sestrin2 expression by metformin
(Fig. 4A). Next, we investigated AMPK activation by
metformin in cells with knockdown of ATF4 and its
downstream targets REDD1 and Sestrin2. H1299 cells
were transfected with ATF4, REDD1 and Sestrin2 siRNAs
and then treated with metformin. Metformininduced
AMPKα and ACC phosphorylation was not
changed by siRNAs against ATF4, REDD1 or Sestrin2
(Fig. 4B-D). These data suggest that AMPK and ATF4
do not affect each other’s expression in response to
metformin.
REDD1 and Sestrin2 expression induced by metformin is
involved in mTORC1 inhibition
We investigated whether REDD1 and/or Sestrin2 induction
by metformin suppresses mTORC1 activity. As
shown in Fig. 5A-C, the decreased phosphorylation of
S6K by metformin was recovered in cells treated with
REDD1 siRNA or Sestrin2 siRNA. Silencing both
REDD1 and Sestrin2 further attenuated the effect of
metformin on the inhibition of S6K phosphorylation.
Interestingly, compared with that in the control siRNAtreated
cells, the metformin-induced Sestrin2 expression
was higher in the REDD1 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5A
and D), and the metformin-induced REDD1 expression
was higher in the Sestrin2 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5B
and E). These data suggest that REDD1 and Sestrin2 are
important for the inhibition of mTORC1 triggered by
metformin treatment.
Lapatinib enhances cell sensitivity to metformin, and
knockdown of REDD1 and Sestrin2 decreases cell sensitivity
to metformin and lapatinib.
Next, we investigated the effect of metformin on
H1299 cell viability. A less than 25% decrease in cell
viability was observed in H1299 cells treated with 10
mM metformin for 24 h (Fig. 6A). The combination of
kinase inhibitor and biguanide has been reported to
have increased antitumour efficacy [30], and we investigated
whether lapatinib, a dual EGFR and HER2 kinase
inhibitor, enhances cell sensitivity to metformin. Interestingly,
lapatinib potentiated the metformin’s effect on
the ATF4, REDD1, and Sestrin2 expression and the
AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). Lapatinib enhanced
the metformin-induced inhibition of S6K phosphorylation
and the inhibitory effect of metformin on the cell
viability (Fig. 6B and C). To investigate whether REDD1
and Sestrin2 are involved in cell sensitivity to lapatinib
and metformin, we knocked down REDD1 and Sestrin2
in H1299 cells, followed by lapatinib and metformin
treatment. siRNA silencing of both REDD1 and Sestrin2
abrogated REDD1 and Sestrin2 expression but did
not affect AMPKα phosphorylation induced by metformin
treatment (Fig. 6D). Treatment with REDD1 and
Sestrin2 siRNA significantly increased viability in cells
treated with metformin and lapatinib, suggesting that
expression of both REDD1 and Sestrin2 is involved in
cell sensitivity to metformin and lapatinib (Fig. 6E).
Next, we knocked down ATF4 in H1299 cells, followed
by lapatinib and metformin treatment to investigate
whether ATF4 is involved in cell sensitivity to lapatinib
and metformin. siRNA-mediated knockdown of ATF4
abrogated the expression of ATF4 and its downstream
targets REDD1 and Sestrin2 induced by metformin
(Fig. 6F). However, ATF4 siRNA did not affect
metformin-induced AMPKα phosphorylation (Fig. 6F).
ATF4 siRNA significantly increased viability in cells
treated with metformin and lapatinib (Fig. 6G). These
results suggest that ATF4-mediated REDD1 and Sestrin2
expression is involved in cell sensitivity to metformin
and lapatinib.
Discussion
In the present study, we provide evidence that metformin
inhibited mTORC1 signalling independent of
AMPK. We found that metformin inhibited mTORC1
signalling via ATF4-induced REDD1 and Sestrin2 expression.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment
with a combination of metformin and lapatinib significantly
reduced the viability of NSCLC cells. siRNAs targeting
REDD1 and Sestrin2 significantly increased
viability in cells treated with metformin and lapatinib.
Our study advances the current understanding of the
molecular mechanism used by metformin to regulate
mTORC1 pathways as a cancer therapy.
Metformin treatment induced AMPK activation and
mTORC1 inhibition (Fig. 1A). It has been reported that
metformin requires AMPK to inhibit mTORC1 [26]. In
this study, we found that metformin-induced AMPK activation
contributed to mTORC1 inhibition. However,
downregulation of AMPK did not fully recover metformininduced
mTORC1 inhibition (Fig. 1B). This result suggests
that there are additional mechanisms involved in the
metformin-mediated inhibition of mTORC1.
REDD1 is one of the best characterized suppressors of
mTORC1. REDD1 promotes the association of PP2A
with PKB/Akt, ultimately leading to TSC2 activation and
mTORC1 inhibition [31]. Sestrin2 has also been reported
to inhibit mTORC1 signalling via activation of
AMPK [32, 33]. More recently, Sestrin2 was proposed to
inhibit mTORC1 through modulation of GATOR complexes
[34, 35]. In this study, we found that mTORC1
was partially suppressed by metformin-induced expression
of REDD1 or Sestrin2 (Fig. 5A and B). These data
suggest that induction of either REDD1 or Sestrin2 alone
by metformin cannot completely inhibit mTORC1, and
REDD1 and Sestrin2 act together to inhibit mTORC1
following metformin treatment. Interestingly, when
compared with control siRNA-treated cells, it was observed
that metformin-induced Sestrin2 expression was
more elevated in REDD1 siRNA-treated cells, and
metformin-induced REDD1 expression was more elevated
in Sestrin2 siRNA-treated cells. Further research is
needed to confirm in these findings.
It has been reported that metformin increases REDD1
expression in a p53-dependent manner [22]. Because the
H1299 cell line used in this study lacks p53, metformininduced
REDD1 expression may be p53-independent. It
has been reported that activation of the PERK-eIF2α-
ATF4 axis is triggered by metformin [27], and upregulation
of REDD1 and Sestrin2 by leucine deprivation is
mediated by ATF4 [36]. We found that REDD1 and Sestrin2
induced by metformin are mediated by ATF4. Furthermore,
we showed that siRNA targeted against ATF4,
REDD1, and Sestrin2 did not change the AMPK activation
induced by metformin. Additionally, AMPKα siRNA
did not change ATF4-induced REDD1 and Sestrin2 expression.
These data suggest that ATF4-induced
mTORC1 inhibition by metformin occurs independent
of AMPK activation.
The combination of kinase inhibitor and biguanide has
been reported to have increased antitumour efficacy
[30]. Lapatinib, a dual EGFR and HER2 kinase inhibitor,
enhanced the metformin’s effect on the ATF4, REDD1,
and Sestrin2 expression and the inhibitory effects of
metformin on the viability of H1299 cells. In cells with
reduced viability due to combined metformin/lapatinib
treatment, treatment with ATF4 siRNA or REDD1/Sestrin2
siRNA significantly increased viability, indicating
that ATF4-mediated REDD1 and Sestrin2 expression is
involved in cell sensitivity to metformin and lapatinib.
In conclusion, ATF4-mediated REDD1 and Sestrin2
expression triggered by metformin plays an important
role in mTORC1 inhibition independent of AMPK activation,
and this signalling pathway could have therapeutic
value.
