Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic pain condition characterised by a 
persistent burning sensation in clinically normal oral mucosa. BMS most commonly 
occurs in middleaged and elderly women. Various local and systemic factors can 
cause oral burning symptoms. When all possible local and systemic factors are 
excluded, burning mouth symptoms can be diagnosed as BMS. Psychophysical tests 
and histopathological data suggest the involvement of peripheral and central 
neuropathic mechanisms in BMS etiopathogenesis. Psychological problems are 
frequently observed in BMS patients. Several mechanisms, including increased 
parafunctional habits, steroid dysregulation, central disinhibition due to taste 
dysfunction, and low dopamine levels in the brain, have been proposed as an 
explanation for the role of psychological factors in BMS pathophysiology. 
However, the causal relationship between BMS and psychological problems remains 
controversial. Given the neuropathic nature of BMS, treatment for it is similar 
to other neuropathic pain conditions. Although various treatment modalities, 
including pharmacological intervention, behavioural therapy and psychotherapy, 
have been proposed, there is no definitive treatment always effective for the 
majority of BMS patients. In conclusion, for better understanding of the 
relationship between BMS and psychological factors, well-designed prospective 
studies are needed. In addition, the evaluation and treatment of psychological 
problems are essential for successful management of BMS patients.
