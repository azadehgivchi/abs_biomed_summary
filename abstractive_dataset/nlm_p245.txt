The Five-Factor Model (FFM) is a dimensional model of general personality 
structure, consisting of the domains of neuroticism (or emotional instability), 
extraversion versus introversion, openness (or unconventionality), agreeableness 
versus antagonism, and conscientiousness (or constraint). The FFM is arguably 
the most commonly researched dimensional model of general personality structure. 
However, a notable limitation of existing measures of the FFM has been a lack of 
coverage of its maladaptive variants. A series of self-report inventories has 
been developed to assess for the maladaptive personality traits that define 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition; DSM-5) 
Section II personality disorders (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) 
from the perspective of the FFM. In this paper, we provide an introduction to 
this Special Section, presenting the rationale and empirical support for these 
measures and placing them in the historical context of the recent revision to 
the APA diagnostic manual. This introduction is followed by 5 papers that 
provide further empirical support for these measures and address current issues 
within the personality assessment literature.
