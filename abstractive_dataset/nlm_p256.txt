Medical conditions that present with psychiatric symptoms are becoming 
increasingly well-recognized in response to the emergence of the field of 
neuroimmunology. As the availability of testing for novel antineuronal 
antibodies has increased, so too has the clinical awareness of this diagnostic 
spectrum. Psychiatrists may have little exposure to this area of expertise, yet 
may be called on to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with 
complex neuropsychiatric syndromes secondary to autoimmune encephalitis. This 
article summarizes the evaluation and management of patients with autoimmune 
encephalitis and describes emerging patterns in phenotype recognition.
