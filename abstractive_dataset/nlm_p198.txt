Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have become a powerful tool in neuroscience research due 
to their genetic tractability, molecular/physiological conservation, small body 
size, ease of experimental manipulations in vivo, and rich behavioral 
repertoire. Zebrafish models and tests are particularly useful in genetics 
research, neurophenotyping, CNS drug screening, as well as in modeling complex 
neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here, we discuss selected examples of 
successful application of zebrafish models to mimicking various aspects of brain 
pathology, and emphasize their developing utility for studying the underlying 
molecular and genetic mechanisms. We also summarize recent advances in 
zebrafish-based CNS disease modeling, and outline new research strategies that 
may significantly improve translational neuroscience and experimental neurology 
research, and drug discovery.
