BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: A number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including 
Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
and, to some extent, depression, involve dysregulation of the brain dopamine 
systems. The etiology of these diseases is multifactorial, involving genetic and 
environmental factors. Evidence suggests that inadequate levels of n-3 (omega- 
3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the brain may represent a risk factor 
for these disorders. These fatty acids, which are derived from the diet, are a 
major component of neuronal membranes and are of particular importance in brain 
development and function. Low levels of n-3 PUFAs in the brain affect the brain 
dopamine systems and, when combined with appropriate genetic and other factors, 
increase the risk of developing these disorders and/or the severity of the 
disease. This article reviews the neurobiology of n-3 PUFAs and their effects on 
dopaminergic function.
CONCLUSION: Clinical studies supporting their role in the etiologies of diseases 
involving the brain dopamine systems and the potential of n-3 PUFAs in the 
treatment of these disorders are discussed.
