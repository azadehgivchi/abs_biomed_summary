Ewald Hecker was the first psychiatrist to describe the disease entity of 
hebephrenia in some detail, focusing mainly on disturbances of affect. Later 
Emil Kraepelin and Eugen Bleuler saw hebephrenia as a subtype of dementia 
praecox or schizophrenia. Willy Mayer-Gross and Karl Leonhard characterized 
hebephrenia with highly differentiated psychopathological descriptions, whereas 
this construct only played a minor role in the works of Klaus Conrad and Kurt 
Schneider. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) lists 
hebephrenia as a subtype of schizophrenia but in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) no subtypes of schizophrenia are mentioned 
and the concept of hebephrenia is thus lost. Hebephrenia can be seen as an ideal 
type describing a psychopathological course pattern. This construct can be 
useful to conceptualize a group of disorders of affect which otherwise escape 
description, especially since these psychopathological alterations of affect are 
difficult to operationalize. To have a viable concept of these disorders is 
relevant for the prognosis and therapy planning. If the concept of hebephrenia 
is abolished, important psychopathological knowledge might be lost for future 
generations of psychiatrists.
