BACKGROUND: Personalised psychiatry requires a psychiatric diagnosis which aims 
to determine the causes of the mental disorder and the context within which it 
has developed, including the factors of most importance for the choice of an 
appropriate treatment.
AIM: To show that psychiatric diagnosis is personalised by definition.
METHOD: Description of the differences between psychiatric classification and 
psychiatric diagnosis, including a discussion of symptom network diagnosis and 
diagnosis of meaningful connections.
RESULTS: It appears from references from classical and recent psychiatric 
textbooks and from the recent Dutch Guideline for psychiatric evaluation that 
psychiatric diagnosis, different from classification, has always been aimed at 
determining both biological and psychosocial etiological and pathogenic factors 
and factors influencing the course and the treatment of the disorder.
CONCLUSION: A personalised approach in psychiatry may lead to a direly necessary 
reappraisal of psychiatric diagnosis that is not limited to the classification 
of symptoms, but that aims specifically towards explaning and understanding 
mental illness.
