The development of mental disorders constitutes a complex phenomenon driven by 
unique social, psychological and biological factors such as genetics and 
epigenetics, throughout an individual's life course. Both environmental and 
genetic factors have an impact on mental health phenotypes and act 
simultaneously to induce changes in brain and behavior. Here, we describe and 
critically evaluate the current literature on gene-environment interactions and 
epigenetics on mental health by highlighting recent human and animal studies. We 
furthermore review some of the main ethical and social implications concerning 
gene-environment interactions and epigenetics and provide explanations and 
suggestions on how to move from statistical and epigenetic associations to 
biological and psychological explanations within a multi-disciplinary and 
integrative approach of understanding mental health.
