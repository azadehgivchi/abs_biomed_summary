The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) is the largest consortium in the 
history of psychiatry. This global effort is dedicated to rapid progress and 
open science, and in the past decade it has delivered an increasing flow of new 
knowledge about the fundamental basis of common psychiatric disorders. The PGC 
has recently commenced a program of research designed to deliver "actionable" 
findings-genomic results that 1) reveal fundamental biology, 2) inform clinical 
practice, and 3) deliver new therapeutic targets. The central idea of the PGC is 
to convert the family history risk factor into biologically, clinically, and 
therapeutically meaningful insights. The emerging findings suggest that we are 
entering a phase of accelerated genetic discovery for multiple psychiatric 
disorders. These findings are likely to elucidate the genetic portions of these 
truly complex traits, and this knowledge can then be mined for its relevance for 
improved therapeutics and its impact on psychiatric practice within a precision 
medicine framework. [AJP at 175: Remembering Our Past As We Envision Our Future
