The quality of postmortem research depends strongly on a thorough clinical 
investigation and documentation of the patient's disorder and therapies. In 
addition, a systematic and professional neuropathologic investigation of both 
cases and controls is absolutely crucial. In the experience of the Netherlands 
Brain Bank (NBB), about 20% of clinical neurologic diagnoses, despite being made 
in first-rate clinics, have to be revised or require an extra diagnosis after a 
complete and thorough review by the NBB. The neuropathology examination may 
reveal for instance that the "controls" already have preclinical 
neurodegenerative alterations. In postmortem studies the patient and control 
groups must be matched for as many of the known confounding factors as possible. 
This is necessary to make the groups as similar as possible, except for the 
topic being investigated. Confounding factors are present before, during, and 
after death. They are respectively: (1) genetic background, systemic diseases, 
duration and gravity of illness, medicines and addictive compounds used, age, 
sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, circadian and seasonal fluctuations, 
lateralization; (2) agonal state, stress of dying; and (3) postmortem delay, 
freezing procedures, fixation and storage time. Consequently, a brain bank 
should have a large number of controls at its disposal for appropriate matching. 
If matching fails for some confounders, then their influence may be determined 
by statistical methods such as analysis of variance or regression models.
