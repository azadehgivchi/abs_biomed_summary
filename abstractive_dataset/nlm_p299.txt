person with mental disorder submitted to ECT and to analyze the implications of 
the Psychiatric Reform in this care.

RESULTS: the nursing team is present in a continuous way in the monitoring of 
people submitted to ECT, performing care before, during and after the same, as 
well as visualizing the evolution of the technique and also of nursing care 
itself, however, does not recognize the Psychiatric Reform as agent for this 
change.

humanization of nursing knowledge, influencing the care of the person with 
mental disorder submitted to ECT, with this, care practices also changed, a law 
was approved, regulating its practice, and its application was decreasing.
