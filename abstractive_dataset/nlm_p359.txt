The article discusses a systematic clinical and psychological approach to 
different types of impaired cognitive development in children and adolescents 
with mental disorders in the context of the concept of cognitive dysontogenesis. 
The authors describe the types of cognitive dysontogenesis in schizophrenic and 
autistic spectrum disorders and present two models of its estimation: with 
complex psychometric and pathopsychological diagnosis and with a support on 
pathopsychological diagnosis of cognitive development only. Special attention is 
paid to domestic techniques developed in MHRC, which classify the types of 
cognitive dysontogenesis in children and adolescents with different disorders of 
mental development without reliance on psychometric indicators. The developed 
model of cognitive development profiles allows to make a conclusion about a 
typical picture of cognitive disorders in different versions of mental 
pathology.
