Mental health is a major concern throughout the world. The lifetime prevalence 
of mental health problems in Singapore for those aged 18Â years and above was 
reported to be 12%. However, studies on mental health literacy are relatively 
scarce in Singapore. The aim of this paper is to provide a topical review of 
local studies on mental health literacy, people's knowledge of, and attitude 
toward mental illness, and beliefs about mental health treatment. A narrative 
review of studies on mental health literacy in Singapore covering the period 
from 1995 to 2016 highlights the findings from various local studies about 
attitudes toward mental illness, belief about the causes, and help-seeking 
behavior. Findings revealed that many lay people are unable to recognize 
different types of mental disorders. Negative attitudes toward mental illness 
that hinders individuals from seeking professional treatment, and help-seeking, 
are the common themes that emerge from the findings. Health professionals have 
differing views about the causes and treatment of mental disorders. Findings 
also revealed that treatment seeking and attitudes and beliefs toward mental 
illness are related to mental health literacy. Implications for promoting mental 
health literacy are provided.
