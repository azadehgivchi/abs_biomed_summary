BACKGROUND: The human gut microbiome comprise a huge number of microorganisms 
with co-evolutionary associations with humans. It has been repeatedly revealed 
that bidirectional communication exists between the brain and the gut and 
involves neural, hormonal, and immunological pathways. Evidences from 
neuroscience researches over the past few years suggest that microbiota is 
essential for the development and maturation of brain systems that are 
associated to stress responses.
METHOD: This review provides that the summarization of the communication among 
microbiota, gut and brain and the results of preclinical and clinical studies on 
gut microbiota used in treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.
RESULT: Recent studies have reported that diverse forms of neuropsychiatric 
disorders (such as autism, depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia) are 
associated with or modulated by variations in the microbiome, by microbial 
substrates, and by exogenous prebiotics, antibiotics, and probiotics.
CONCLUSION: The microbiota-gut-brain axis might provide novel targets for 
prevention and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, further studies 
are required to substantiate the clinical use of probiotics, prebiotics and FMT.
