Exploration of neuroimmune mechanisms is vital to the understanding of the 
pathogenesis and pathophysiology of mental disorders. Inflammatory and immune 
mechanisms are increasingly understood to underpin a number of neuropsychiatric 
disorders, with an ever-expanding evidence base drawn from basic science to 
large-scale epidemiological data. Unravelling of these mechanisms should lead to 
biomarker discovery and potential new avenues for therapeutics that modulate 
immunological mechanisms. Identification of neuroimmune biomarkers is vital to 
improving diagnosis, stratification and treatment of mental disorders. There is 
an urgent clinical need for new therapeutic approaches with poor treatment 
response and treatment resistance a major problem for many psychiatric disorders 
including depression and schizophrenia. Neurodegenerative psychiatric disorders 
such as Alzheimer's also have clear neuroimmune underpinnings and manifest an 
urgent clinical need for improvements in diagnosis and research towards 
transformative disease-modifying treatments. This chapter provides some 
background on the role of the neuroimmune system in mental illness, exploring 
the role for biomarkers, in addition to reviewing the current state of knowledge 
in this exciting field. We also reflect on the inherent challenges and 
methodological pitfalls faced by research in this field, including the 
complexity of conceptualising multidimensional mental disorders and the dynamic 
shifting sands of the immune system.
