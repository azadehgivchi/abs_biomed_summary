Few publications deal with non-neurogenic language disorders 
(NNLDs), distinct from psychogenic speech disorders such as psychogenic 
dysphonia or stuttering. NNLDs are alterations in language owing to 
psychosomatic preoccupations, conversion disorder, psychiatric disorders, or 
other psychological reasons.
To identify and classify the range of NNLDs and their 
characteristics.
This review summarizes the literature on disturbances in language, 
broadly defined as the use of symbols for communication, which may have a 
psychogenic or psychiatric etiology.
The literature suggests a classification for NNLDs that includes 
psychogenic aphasia with dysgrammatism; psychogenic "lalias" including oxylalia 
and agitolalia, palilalia and echolalia, xenolalia, glossolalia, and coprolalia; 
psychologically-mediated word usage; psychotic language; and psychogenic forms 
of the foreign accent syndrome.
Clinicians and researchers have insufficiently emphasized the 
presence of NNLDs, their characteristics, and their identification. Yet, these 
disorders may be the first or predominant manifestation of a 
psychologically-mediated illness. There are 2 steps to recognition. The first is 
to know how to distinguish NNLDs from the manifestations of neurogenic language 
impairments after a neurological evaluation. The second step is awareness of 
specific associated and examination features that suggest the presence of a 
NNLD.
