Borderline personality disorder (BPD) comprises a heterogeneous 
constellation of problems operationalized in the DSM-5 and the forthcoming 
ICD-11. In schema therapy, schemas and modes are employed to conceptualize and 
treat these problems.
The current study investigated whether the 9 diagnostic BPD features are 
associated with schemas and modes.
Psychiatric outpatients with predominant BPD features (n = 142; 68% 
females) were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II 
(SCID-II) and self-report inventories for schemas and modes. Associations were 
investigated by means of bivariate point-biserial correlations and multiple 
logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: BPD features were largely associated with conceptually related schemas 
and modes. Consistent with the schema therapy literature and previous research, 
we found schemas of Abandonment/Instability and Mistrust/Abuse along with modes 
of Angry/Enraged Child, (internalized) Punitive Parent, and Impulsive Child to 
uniquely predict thematically related BPD features including fear of 
abandonment, self-destructiveness, feelings of emptiness, stress-related 
paranoid ideation, inappropriate anger, and impulsivity.
Most of the 9 BPD features were related to conceptually meaningful 
schemas/modes, suggesting that BPD is composed of dormant themes along with 
salient affective-behavioral responses. Consequently, individual BPD features 
may be differentially conceptualized and targeted in therapy by means of schemas 
and modes.
