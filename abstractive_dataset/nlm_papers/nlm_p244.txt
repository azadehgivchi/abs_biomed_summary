Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a cheap, easy to use, and 
relatively safe noninvasive brain stimulation technique. It is increasingly used 
in several indications in psychiatry and neurology, mainly for depression, 
chronic pain and cognitive decline due to degenerative brain diseases. Its 
efficacy is probable in depression and must still be confirmed in numerous other 
indications. Lowcost devices for the general public are easy to find on the 
internet and are frequently used for non-therapeutic indications, like the 
improvement of video gamers' performances. A non-medical use could represent a 
public health hazard, due to lack of control on stimulation parameters i.e. 
localization, duration and intensity.
