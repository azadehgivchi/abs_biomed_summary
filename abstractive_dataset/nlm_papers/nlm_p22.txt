Social behavioral disturbances are central to most psychiatric disorders. A disequilibrium within the cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems underlies these deficits. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are the most abundant excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain that contribute to this equilibrium. Several contemporary therapies used in treating psychiatric disorders, regulate this GABA-glutamate balance. Yoga has been studied as an adjuvant treatment across a broad range of psychiatric disorders and is shown to have short-term therapeutic gains. Emerging evidence from recent clinical in vivo experiments suggests that yoga improves GABA-mediated cortical-inhibitory tone and enhances peripheral oxytocin levels. This is likely to have a more controlled downstream response of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal system by means of reduced cortisol release and hence a blunted sympathetic response to stress. Animal and early fetal developmental studies suggest an inter-dependent role of oxytocin and GABA in regulating social behaviors. In keeping with these observations, we propose an integrated neurobiological model to study the mechanisms of therapeutic benefits with yoga. Apart from providing a neuroscientific basis for applying a traditional system of practice in the clinical setting, this model can be used as a framework for studying yoga mechanisms in future clinical trials.
