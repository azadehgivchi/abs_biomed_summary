Higher animals, especially the human beings have the privilege of 
employing advanced central nervous system (CNS) as well as the evolved immune 
system to ward off various onslaughts throughout their life. Alterations in 
inflammatory and neural regulatory pathways lead to several disorders that are 
now becoming the cause of concern across the world. Deregulation in 
bidirectional network, particularly in aging population, leads to several 
neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia as a one of the major 
characteristics.
Interestingly, research updates have signified the role of abrupt 
immune regulation in several brain diseases, establishing a link between altered 
immune system and CNS related diseases. In the later period of life, the altered 
immune response in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, has become 
more visible. In the present manuscript, we present a synopsis on the linkage of 
CNS and immune system with respect to psychology, with the aim to further 
understand the biological machinery of psychoneuroimmunological disorders. The 
immune system of human being plays an important role in keeping pathogen 
onslaughts on bay.
Our manuscript concludes a close relationship between emotion and 
psychology to diseases and immunology, proclaiming the need of providing 
enhanced attention on mechanistic aspect of psychoneuroimmunological disorders.
