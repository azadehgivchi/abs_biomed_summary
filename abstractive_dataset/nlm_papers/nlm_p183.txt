Assess the relationship between psychiatric relapses of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the levels of expressed emotion among their relatives and related factors.
Prospective study carried out at a mental health outpatient clinic and 
two Psychosocial Care Centers, with patients and relatives responding to the 
Family Questionnaire - Brazilian Portuguese Version, a form containing 
socio-demographic and clinical variables and a structured script to assess 
relapses. A logistic regression model was used for the analysis.
A total of 89 dyads participated in the study. Of the patients 
investigated, 31% presented relapses and, among the relatives, 68% presented 
elevated levels of expressed emotion. The relationship between expressed emotion 
and the relapses was not significant. The logistic regression analysis 
demonstrated that when there were a higher number of hospital admissions in the 
two years preceding the study, the chance of the patient relapsing in the 
24-month period is 1.34.
Expressed emotion was insufficient to predict relapses. Thus, a 
relapse should be understood as a multifactorial phenomenon. These results 
provide support for interventions and investigations on the multiple factors 
involved in the evolution of schizophrenia patients in follow-up at 
community-based health services.
