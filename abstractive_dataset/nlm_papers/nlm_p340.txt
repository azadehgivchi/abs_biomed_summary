To evaluate the efficacy of gelototherapy (laughter therapy) in the complex 
treatment of borderline (neurotic) disorders.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and ten patients with the ICD-10 diagnosis of 
neurotic disorder were studied. Of them, 70 received gelototherapy, along with 
pharmacotherapy; the comparison group of included 40 patients. Common clinical 
methods and psychiatric evaluation, which was supplemented by two questionnaires 
for quantitative assessment of symptom severity, were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A positive (highly reliable for a number of indicators) 
effect of gelototherapy on the mental state of patients was demonstrated. The 
results suggest that gelototherapy can be used within the framework of 
psychotherapy of borderline mental disorders, including in combination with 
pharmacotherapy.
