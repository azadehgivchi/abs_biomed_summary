Recovery after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is variable, even for patients with similar severity of brain injury. Recent research has highlighted the contribution that genetic predisposition plays in determining TBI outcome. This review considers the potential for genetic polymorphisms to influence recovery of cognitive and social processes following TBI. Limitations and considerations that researchers should make when assessing the potential impact of polymorphisms on TBI outcome are also discussed. Understanding the genetic factors that support neuroplasticity will contribute to an understanding of the variation in outcome following injury and help to identify potential targets for rehabilitation.
