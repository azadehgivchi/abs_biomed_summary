Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BPD) are the 
most severe mood disorders globally. Previous reports indicate high 
co-occurrence of cannabis use and cannabis use disorders (CUDs) associated with 
both disorders, yet studies comparing patterns of cannabis use between 
individuals with MDD and BPD are scarce.
Data were drawn from Wave 1 (2001-2002) of the National Epidemiologic 
survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Cannabis users who qualified 
for a diagnosis of past-year MDD (N=217) were compared to those with BPD (N=168) 
in frequency and daily dose of cannabis use, rates of comorbid psychiatric 
disorders including specific criteria of CUDs, treatment utilization and 
suicidality.
Among past-year cannabis users, individuals with BPD reported using 
cannabis more frequently and smoking more joints per day compared to those with 
MDD. They were also more likely to suffer from comorbid personality disorders 
and qualify for specific CUD-criteria, including use in physically hazardous 
situations and unsuccessful efforts to control substance use.
Our results indicate that individuals with BPD may present more 
intensive patterns of cannabis use compared to those with MDD. This may have 
potential effects on the course of BPD and should be further explored in 
longitudinal studies.
