The present article provides a theoretical viewpoint on several aspects in 
frontal asymmetry research. Based on a brief overview of evidence related to an 
approach-avoidance perspective and the relation to BIS-BAS models on frontal 
asymmetry I propose that intentionality is valuable to understanding frontal 
asymmetry. In particular, I argue that defining arguments and previous 
experimental research often focused on a phase of human action that may be 
denoted as a volitional phase, which is linked to intentions. Further, I argue 
that intentions are accompanied by an affective-motivational component that I 
denote as the strength of an intention. Finally, I suggest that the lack of this 
kind of intentional strength might be an interesting concept in trying to 
explain certain subtypes of depression.
