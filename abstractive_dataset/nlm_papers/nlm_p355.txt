Over the past two decades research has consistently found that bisexual people 
experience poorer mental health than their gay, lesbian or heterosexual 
counterparts. The reasons behind this high prevalence of poor mental health 
remain under-researched and largely unknown. In order to improve these outcomes, 
more research is critically needed with the aim of providing new knowledge upon 
which health care provision and policy development can be based. This article 
presents an analysis of the literature to date relating to bisexuality broadly 
and bisexual mental health specifically, with the aim of providing direction for 
future research projects.
