The morphological landmarks suggested by E. Kretschmer for delineation of three 
basic types of somatic constitutions: picnic, athletic and leptosome are 
analyzed, the critics of declared affinity of bodily structure to cycloid or 
schizoid type of psyche is also considered. The influence of the ideas of 
Italian anthropometric school on the Kretschmer's morphologic concept is marked. 
E. Kretschmer's negation of 'degeneration' theory that was the ground for the 
development of psychopathy doctrine is underlined. Due to that negation physical 
stigmata (dysplastic bodily structure), sexual anomalies and character 
disharmonies having been described according to 'degeneration' concept as 
general signs of predisposition to mental disorders were included according to 
the Kretschmer's concept into 'schizoid' group.
