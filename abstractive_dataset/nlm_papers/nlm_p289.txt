To our knowledge, the association of obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD) and academic performance has not been objectively quantified.
To investigate the association of OCD with objectively measured 
educational outcomes in a nationwide cohort, adjusting for covariates and 
unmeasured factors shared between siblings.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based birth cohort study 
included 2 115 554 individuals who were born in Sweden between January 1, 1976, 
and December 31, 1998, and followed up through December 31, 2013. Using the 
Swedish National Patient Register and previously validated International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth 
Revision (ICD-10) codes, we identified persons with OCD; within the cohort, we 
identified 726 198 families with 2 or more full siblings, and identified 11 482 
families with full siblings discordant for OCD. Data analyses were conducted 
from October 1, 2016, to September 25, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The study evaluates the following educational 
milestones: eligibility to access upper secondary school after compulsory 
education, finishing upper secondary school, starting a university degree, 
finishing a university degree, and finishing postgraduate education.
Of the 2 115 554 individuals in the cohort, 15 120 were diagnosed with 
OCD (59% females). Compared with unexposed individuals, those with OCD were 
significantly less likely to pass all core and additional courses at the end of 
compulsory school (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] range, 0.35-0.60) and to access a 
vocational or academic program in upper secondary education (aOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 
0.45-0.50 and aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.58-0.63, for vocational and academic 
programs, respectively). People with OCD were also less likely to finish upper 
secondary education (aOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.41-0.44), start a university degree 
(aOR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.69-0.75), finish a university degree (aOR, 0.59; 95% CI, 
0.56-0.62), and finish postgraduate education (aOR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36-0.77). 
The results were similar in the sibling comparison models. Individuals diagnosed 
with OCD before age 18 years showed worse educational attainment across all 
educational levels compared with those diagnosed at or after age 18 years. 
Exclusion of patients with comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders, psychotic, 
anxiety, mood, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders resulted in 
attenuated estimates, but patients with OCD were still impaired across all 
educational outcomes
Obsessive-compulsive disorder, particularly when it 
has an early onset, is associated with a pervasive and profound decrease in 
educational attainment, spanning from compulsory school to postgraduate 
education.
