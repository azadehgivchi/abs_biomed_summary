Synthetic cannabinoid products have become popular and have led to an increased 
number of patients presenting to emergency departments and psychiatric 
hospitals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of synthetic 
cannabinoid use at admission on length of stay and doses of antipsychotics at 
discharge in individuals with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other 
psychotic disorders. We retrospectively examined medical records of 324 
inpatients admitted from January 2014 to July 2015. We found that synthetic 
cannabinoid use predicted length of stay and antipsychotic dose using structural 
equation modeling. Further, the association of synthetic cannabinoid use with 
length of stay was partly mediated by antipsychotic dose. These associations 
were independent of specific diagnosis. In conclusion, patients with bipolar 
disorder, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders who reported synthetic 
cannabinoid use at admission had shorter length of stay and received lower doses 
of antipsychotics, irrespective of clinical diagnoses.
