Functioning and quality of life (QOL) are negatively impacted as a 
result of mental illness. This study aimed to determine the: i) 
socio-demographic and clinical correlates of functioning and; ii) associations 
between functioning and QOL in a multiethnic sample of psychiatric outpatients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of outpatients receiving 
treatment from a tertiary psychiatric hospital. Functioning was assessed using 
the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, while QOL was measured using 
the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) which comprises 
4 domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships and 
environment.
Various socio-demographic and clinical correlates were associated with 
functioning including employment and marital status, education and diagnosis. 
Depression was the only clinical characteristic which negatively correlated with 
functioning (P = 0.035). Amongst the whole sample, multiple linear regressions 
revealed that functioning was positively associated with all 4 QOL domains 
(physical health [P <0.001], psychological health [P <0.001], social 
relationships [P <0.001] and environment [P <0.001]). Further analysis of each 
diagnostic group revealed that functioning was positively associated with all 4 
QOL domains in the anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder 
subsamples, while in the schizophrenia subsample, functioning was only 
significantly associated with all environment domain.
Functional impairments were associated with different 
socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, which should be addressed when 
planning tailored treatment and interventions. Given that functioning is 
significantly associated with QOL, it is crucial to regularly assess and monitor 
them (in addition to symptomatic outcomes and adopting a more holistic and 
biopsychosocial approach).
