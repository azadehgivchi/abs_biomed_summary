The last literature review on psychopathological features in 
Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 had been conducted by Ambrosini and Nurnberg in 1979. 
Since that date, many researches had been carried out.
The aim of this study is (i) to systematically obtain and evaluate 
the relevant literature on psychopathological features, personality, and coping 
in individuals with adult phenotypes of Myotonic Dystrophy type 1. (ii) To 
summarize current research findings and draw conclusions for future research.
A systematic search was conducted on Pubmed, PubPsych, PsycInfo, 
Science Direct, and Scopus covering the period of January 1979 to July 2017.
RESULTS: In view of our literature review, patients show mild psychopathological 
problems, such as interpersonal difficulties, lack of interest, dysphoria, 
concern about bodily functioning, and hypersensibility. However, they do not 
experience more psychiatric disorder in comparison to the general population, 
except for personality disorders and depression. We discussed problems 
concerning depression's assessment tool. Patients also present symptoms of 
several personality disorders: avoidant personality disorder was the most 
common. Finally, coping strategies relative to limitations resulting from their 
disease have a negative impact on their quality of life.
In conclusion, Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 patients did not present 
homogeneous psychopathological and psychological features. However, based on 
tendencies observed among Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 patients, elements to 
conceptualize their social difficulties are provided.
