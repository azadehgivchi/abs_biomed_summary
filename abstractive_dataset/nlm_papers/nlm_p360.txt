Internet-supported and therapist-guided cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is 
effective for a range of problems in the short run, but less is known about the 
long-term effects with follow-ups of two years or longer. Areas covered: This 
paper reviews studies in which the long-term effects of guided ICBT were 
investigated. Following literature searches in PubMed and other sources 
meta-analytic statistics were calculated for 14 studies involving a total of 902 
participants, and an average follow-up period of three years. Studies were from 
Sweden (n = 11) or the Netherlands (n = 3). Long-term outcome studies were found 
for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, 
depression, mixed anxiety and depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
pathological gambling, stress and chronic fatigue. The duration of the 
treatments was usually short (8-15 weeks). The pre-to follow-up effect size was 
Hedge's g = 1.52, but with a significant heterogeneity. The average symptom 
improvement across studies was 50%. Treatment seeking in the follow-up period 
was not documented and few studies mentioned negative effects. Expert 
commentary: While effects may be overestimated, it is likely that 
therapist-supported ICBT can have enduring effects. Long-term follow-up data 
should be collected for more conditions and new technologies like 
smartphone-delivered treatments.
