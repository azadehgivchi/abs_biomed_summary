Changes in mood, emotions, and behavior are common components of the acute 
clinical picture of sport-related concussion (SRC). Common concussion symptom 
inventories such as the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-5 (SCAT5) contain a 
large number of questions that assess these neuropsychiatric domains. In fact, 
of 22 items assessed by the SCAT5, arguably only five of the items do not 
overlap with symptoms assessed by standard measures of anxiety and depression, 
suggesting that concussion is best viewed as a neuropsychiatric syndrome. 
Furthermore, it is important to understand the complex relationship between 
preinjury psychologic health, acute injury symptom profile, and the role that 
changes in mood, emotions, and behavior play in the recovery trajectory after 
concussion. Some research suggests that there may also be long-term 
neuropsychiatric effects of concussion, repetitive concussion, and repetitive 
head impacts. This chapter provides a review of the neuropsychiatric sequelae of 
acute SRC, the current evidence for long-term neuropsychiatric effects of 
repetitive concussion, and the impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms on recovery 
trajectory. Clinical principles relevant to management are described.
