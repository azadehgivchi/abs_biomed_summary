Driving aggression and anxiety are significant contributors to risky 
driving and motor vehicle crashes (MVCs), which are leading causes of U.S. 
morbidity and mortality. Even though aggression and anxiety can be 
conceptualized as related features of the fight-or-flight response, literature 
on these topics has not been integrated. Driving aggression and anxiety are also 
transdiagnostic constructs that span multiple psychiatric disorders. Assessment 
and treatment of these complex problems must be understood to reduce the public 
health burden of MVCs.
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PsycInfo and 
Google Scholar.
RESULTS: Definitions and prevalence of constructs including driving anger, 
aggressive driving, posttraumatic stress disorder, driving phobia, and 
transdiagnostic factors are delineated. Psychosocial correlates and assessment 
instruments are reviewed. Theoretical models that explicate personological, 
affective, cognitive, and behavioral components are explored. Differential and 
shared processes underlying driving aggression and anxiety are examined. 
Interventions are described, with a focus on promising cognitive-behavioral 
methods.
Driving aggression and anxiety likely share affective and cognitive 
characteristics such as emotional reactivity and distorted threat appraisals. 
Further research is needed to support theoretical models linking driving 
aggression and anxiety, and to validate assessment instruments that capture both 
constructs. Epidemiologic studies are needed to determine norms, prevalence, and 
clinical cutpoints. Integration of interventions for these interrelated problems 
could ultimately reduce risky driving and MVCs.
