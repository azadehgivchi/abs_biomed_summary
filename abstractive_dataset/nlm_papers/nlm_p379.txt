Toxoplasma gondii may play a role in the development of psychiatric 
diseases by affecting the brain. The purpose of this study was to examine the 
relation between serum toxoplasma IgG positivity and obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in children and 
adolescents.
Sixty patients diagnosed with OCD and 60 patients with GAD presenting to 
the pediatric psychiatry clinic, together with 60 control group subjects with no 
psychiatric diagnosis, were included in the study. The patients were 
administered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and the Children's 
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. Serum toxoplasma IgG levels were 
determined from blood specimens collected from the study and control groups. The 
results were then compared using statistical methods.
State and trait anxiety levels were significantly higher in the OCD and 
GAD patients than in the control group (p = .0001/.0001). Serum toxoplasma IgG 
levels were positive in 21 (35%) of the OCD patients, 19 (31.7%) of the GAD 
patients and 6 (10%) of the control group. A significant relation was determined 
between IgG positivity and GAD (p = .003). IgG-positive individuals were 
determined to have a 4.171-fold greater risk of GAD compared to those without 
positivity (4.171[1.529-11.378]) (p = .005). A significant relation was also 
determined between IgG positivity and OCD (p = .001). IgG-positive individuals 
were determined to have a 4.846-fold greater risk of OCD compared to those 
without positivity (4.846[1.789-13.126]) (p = .002).
This study shows that serum toxoplasma IgG positivity indicating 
previous toxoplasma infection increased the risk of GAD 4.171-fold and the risk 
of OCD 4.846-fold in children and adolescents. Further studies are now needed to 
investigate the relation between T. gondii infection and GAD/OCD and to 
determine the pathophysiology involved.
