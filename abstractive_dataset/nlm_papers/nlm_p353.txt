To develop a primary care eating disorder screen with greater 
accuracy and greater potential for generalizability, compared to existing 
screens.
Cross-sectional survey to assess discriminative accuracy of a new 
screen, Screen for Disordered Eating (SDE), compared to Eating Disorders Screen 
for Primary Care (EDS-PC) and SCOFF screener, using prevalence rates of Binge 
Eating Disorder (BED), Bulimia Nervosa (BN), Anorexia Nervosa (AN), and Any 
Eating Disorder (AED), as measured by the Eating Disorder Examination 
Questionnaire (EDE-Q).
The SDE correctly classified 87.2% (CI: 74.3%-95.2%) of BED cases, all 
cases of BN and AN, and 90.5% (CI: 80.4%-96.4%) of AED cases. Sensitivity 
estimates were higher than the SCOFF, which correctly identified 69.6% (CI: 
54.2%-82.3%) of BED, 77.8% (CI: 40.0%-97.2%) of BN, 37.5% (CI: 8.52%-75.5%) of 
AN, and 66.1% (CI: 53%-77.7%) of AED. While the EDS-PC had slightly higher 
sensitivity than the SDE, the SDE had better specificity. The SDE outperformed 
the SCOFF in classifying true cases, the EDS-PC in classifying true non-cases, 
and the EDS-PC in distinguishing cases from non-cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The SDE is the first screen, inclusive of BED, valid for detecting 
eating disorders in primary care. Findings have broad implications to address 
eating disorder screening in primary care settings.
