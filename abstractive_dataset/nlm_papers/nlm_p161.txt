Psychiatric and substance-use disorders have been associated with 
premature biological ageing. Telomere length (TL), considered an ageing marker, 
has been analysed in psychiatric disorders, and to a lesser extent in 
substance-use disorders, with recent findings suggesting TL may be related to 
disease pathology.
We conducted a critical and non-systematic literature search of TL 
studies published up to June 2016 in psychiatric and substance-use disorders, 
focussing on studies describing mechanisms, including studies linking telomere 
biology with genetic factors, stress and mitochondrial alterations (104 studies 
selected).
Patients with major depressive disorder and anxiety appear to have 
shorter leukocyte telomeres compared to controls. Inconclusive results are found 
for other psychiatric disorders and for substance-use disorders. This may be due 
in part to differences in medication treatment and response, as studies suggest 
that some psychotropic medications may modulate TL. Importantly, some studies 
establish a relationship between telomere machinery, stress and mitochondria 
function in psychiatric and substance-use disorders.
While further longitudinal studies considering telomere genetics 
are needed to clarify the cause-effect link between telomeres and mitochondria 
function in psychiatric and substance-use disorders, the recent findings linking 
these biological processes suggest that telomeres may be more than ageing 
markers.
