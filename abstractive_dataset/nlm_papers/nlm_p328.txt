The development of advanced neuroimaging techniques and their deployment in 
large cohorts has enabled an assessment of functional and structural brain 
network architecture at an unprecedented level of detail. Across many temporal 
and spatial scales, network neuroscience has emerged as a central focus of 
intellectual efforts, seeking meaningful descriptions of brain networks and 
explanatory sets of network features that underlie circuit function in health 
and dysfunction in disease. However, the tools of network science commonly 
deployed provide insight into brain function at a fundamentally descriptive 
level, often failing to identify (patho-)physiological mechanisms that link 
system-level phenomena to the multiple hierarchies of brain function. Here we 
describe recently developed techniques stemming from advances in complex systems 
and network science that have the potential to overcome this limitation, thereby 
contributing mechanistic insights into neuroanatomy, functional dynamics, and 
pathology. Finally, we build on the Research Domain Criteria framework, 
highlighting the notion that mental illnesses can be conceptualized as 
dysfunctions of neural circuitry present across conventional diagnostic 
boundaries, to sketch how network-based methods can be combined with 
pharmacological, intermediate phenotype, genetic, and magnetic stimulation 
studies to probe mechanisms of psychopathology.
