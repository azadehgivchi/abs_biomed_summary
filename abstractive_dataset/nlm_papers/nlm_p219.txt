A cross-sectional study design was used to examine the associations of ethnic 
identity, acculturation, and psychiatric service utilization among Wave 2 
respondents of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol Related Conditions 
with 12-month psychiatric disorders who self-identified as Black (6587, 19%) and 
Hispanic (6359, 18%). Weighted multivariable regression analyses were conducted 
to examine the relationships between ethnic identity, acculturation, and 
12-month psychiatric service utilization. Stronger ethnic identity was 
associated with decreased odds of using psychiatric services among Black 
(AOR = 0.956; CI = 0.923-0.991) and Hispanic individuals (AOR = 0.967; 
CI = 0.945-0.990). Greater acculturation was associated with an increased odds 
of psychiatric service utilization for Hispanic individuals (AOR = 1.025; 
CI = 1.000-1.050). These findings suggest that a sense of pride, belonging, and 
attachment to one's racial/ethnic group and participating in ethnic behaviors is 
associated with lower rates of participation in psychiatric services; 
alternatively, acquiring key elements of the U.S. culture is associated with 
greater participation in psychiatric services.
