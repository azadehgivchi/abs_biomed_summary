We examined associations between parenting style and past-year mental 
disorders in a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of US 
adolescents and whether the associations differed by adolescent demographic 
characteristics.
The sample included 6483 adolescents aged 13-18Â years who were 
interviewed for a full range of DSM-IV mental disorders. Parenting style was 
assessed by adolescent-reported maternal and paternal care and control using 
items from the Parental Bonding Instrument. We controlled for 
socio-demographics, parental history of mental disorders, stressful life events, 
sexual violence, inter-parental conflict, and household composition. We also 
tested for two-way interactions between parental care and control and adolescent 
age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: In adjusted models, high maternal care was associated with lower odds 
of depressive, eating, and behavioral disorders, and high maternal control was 
associated with greater odds of depressive, anxiety, eating, and behavioral 
disorders. High paternal care was associated with lower odds of social phobia 
and alcohol abuse/dependence. High paternal control was associated with greater 
odds of agoraphobia and alcohol abuse/dependence but with lower odds of 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Associations of maternal and paternal 
control with anxiety disorders and substance abuse/dependence differed by sex. 
High paternal care was associated with lower odds of anxiety disorders only 
among Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceived parental care and control were associated with adolescent 
mental disorders after controlling for multiple potential confounders. 
Differential patterns of association were found according to adolescent sex and 
race/ethnicity. Findings have implications for prevention and intervention 
programs that incorporate familial contextual factors.
