To evaluate childhood trauma in relation to criminal behavior, 
dissociative experiences, adverse family experiences during childhood and 
psychiatric backgrounds among prison inmates.
In total, 200 prison inmates were included in this questionnaire-based 
study. Data on demographic characteristics, adverse family experiences during 
childhood and psychiatric backgrounds were collected via face-to-face 
interviews, and a psychometric evaluation was conducted using the Childhood 
Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-28) and Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES).
Several historical items were more common in females than in males 
including family history of psychiatric disease (23.0% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.048), a 
personal history of psychiatric disease (51.0% vs. 29.0%, p < 0.001), and 
previous suicide attempts (49.0% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.001). In male inmates, in 
contrast, there were higher rates of substance abuse (48.0% vs. 29.0%, 
p < 0.001) and previous convictions (50.0% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.001). Males had a 
younger age at first crime (24.9 ± 8.9 years vs. 30.3 ± 9.2 years, p < 0.001), 
whereas females had higher rates of violent crimes (69.2% vs. 30.8% p < 0.001) 
and higher CTQ total scores (51.9 ± 20.9 vs. 46.2 ± 18.9, p = 0.04). A 
significant relationship of CTQ total score was noted with age at first offense 
(β = 0.772, p < 0.001) but not with sentence length (β = 0.075, p = 0.292). 
There were also possible mediating roles of psychiatric problems, adverse family 
experiences and DES in the relationship between CTQ and age at first offense.
In conclusion, our findings revealed a high prevalence of and 
significant associations among childhood trauma, dissociative experiences, 
adverse family experiences and psychiatric problems in a cohort of incarcerated 
females and males. A psychiatric background, childhood trauma characterized by 
sexual abuse and violent crimes were found to be predominant in female prison 
inmates, whereas a criminal background with a younger age at first offense and 
frequent previous convictions, substance use and sexual crimes were more 
prevalent among male prison inmates. Our findings indicate a potential link 
between childhood traumatization and criminal behavior in terms of subsequent 
offending but not in terms of severity of the subsequent offense.
