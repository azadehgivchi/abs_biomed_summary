Within psychiatric practice and policy there is considerable 
controversy surrounding the nature and assessment of impairments of 
decision-making capacity (DMC) for treatment in persons diagnosed with affective 
disorders. We identify the problems of "cognitive bias" and "outcome bias" in 
assessment of DMC for treatment in affective disorder and aim to help resolve 
these problems with an analysis of how time is experienced in depression and 
mania.
SAMPLING AND METHODS: We conducted purposeful sampling and a qualitative 
phenomenological analysis of interview data on patients with depression and 
mania, exploring temporal experience and decision-making regarding treatment.
RESULTS: In both severe depression and mania there is a distinctive experience 
of the future. Two consequences can follow: a loss of evaluative differentiation 
concerning future outcomes and, relatedly, inductive failure. This temporal 
inability can compromise an individual's ability to appreciate or "use or weigh" 
treatment information.
The decision-making abilities required for self-determination 
involve an ability to evaluate alternative future outcomes. Our results show 
that, within severe depression or mania, anticipation of future outcomes is 
inflexibly fixed at one end of the value spectrum. We therefore propose a 
temporal model of decision-making abilities, which could be used to improve 
assessment of DMC in affective disorder.
