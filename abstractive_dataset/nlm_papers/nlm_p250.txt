Drug addiction has a great negative influence on society, both social and 
economic burden. It was widely thought that addicts could choose to stop using 
drugs if only they had some self-control and principles. Nowadays, science has 
changed this view, defining drug addiction as a complex brain disease that 
affects behavior in many ways, both biological and psychological. Currently 
there is no ground-breaking reliable treatment for drug addiction. For more than 
a decade we are researching an alternative approach for intervention with drug 
craving and relapse to its usage, using DHEA, a well-being and antiaging food 
supplement. In this chapter we navigate through the significant therapeutic 
effect of DHEA on the brain circuits that control addiction and on behavioral 
performance both in animal models and addicts. We suggest that an integrative 
program of add-on DHEA treatment may further enable to dynamically evaluate the 
progress of rehabilitation of an individual patient, in a comprehensive 
assessment. Such a program may boost and support the detoxification and 
rehabilitation process, and help patients regain a normal life in a shorter 
amount of time.
