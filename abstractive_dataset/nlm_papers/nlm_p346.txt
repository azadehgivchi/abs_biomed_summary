Dermatillomania is characterized by excessive and repeated skin picking 
sufficient to damage cutaneous tissue, but with no underlying dermatological 
disease. The condition appears as an independent diagnosis in the 
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders category in the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. A psychiatric pathology 
is generally reported to accompany this symptom. Attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) is a potentially lifelong condition involving inattentiveness, 
hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is 
one of the most common childhood psychiatric disorders. Treatment includes 
medication, psychotherapy, and psychosocial therapies. Psychostimulants 
constitute the basis of treatment of children with ADHD worldwide. We describe a 
case of skin picking developing after methylphenidate therapy for ADHD. Possible 
explanations of methylphenidate and skin picking are reviewed in the light of 
the current literature.
