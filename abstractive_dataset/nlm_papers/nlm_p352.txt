From the ancient Greeks (V to III centuries BC), through Hippocrates to the 
Roman physician Aulo Cornelius Celso (I century), the term paranoia has been 
used as a manifestation of mental illness. After many centuries, Robert Burton 
in 1621 introduces the concept with a more modern meaning. Only with Heinroth 
(1818) the syndrome enters into the psychiatric nosology as a disorder of 
thought with unaltered perceptions. French and German psychiatry agree on the 
concept of paranoia as a partial psychosis with a maintained level of 
functioning and absence of deterioration. With this meaning the term is 
introduced in the modern psychiatry in Kahlbaum's work (1863). Jasper 
contributes with the introduction of paranoid development that can be influenced 
by the environment or previous experiences (1910). But to Kraepelin (1921) is 
owed the most precise description in a specifc essay based on his clinical 
experience. The German psychiatrist speaks of both a psychogenic and a more 
biological component. In modern psychiatric classifcations gradually the 
syndrome has disappeared and encompassed in the generic delusional disorder, 
clearly distinct from schizophrenia, and only if the delusions are 
understandable. The consequences of the absence of a diagnostic recognition 
implies that there is no specific research on this syndrome with difficulties in 
developing psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments.
