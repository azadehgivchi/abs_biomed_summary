Under- or overfeeding during pregnancy can lead to behavioral deficits in the 
offspring in later life. Here, we present a protocol for setting up and carrying 
out the hyperlocomotion test for assessing behavioral symptoms such as psychosis 
or mania. As an example, we use the acute rat phencyclidine-injection model 
which exhibits hyperlocomotion and stereotypic behaviors, resembling the 
positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
