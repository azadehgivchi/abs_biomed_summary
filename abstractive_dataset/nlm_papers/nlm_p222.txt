Impairment in personality functioning (PF) represents a salient 
criterion of the DSM-5 alternative diagnostic model for personality disorders 
(AMPD). The main goal of this study is to analyze the relationship of the 
borderline personality disorder (BPD) clinical components derived from the DSM-5 
categorical diagnostic model (affective dysregulation, behavioral dysregulation, 
and disturbed relatedness) with personality organization (PO), i.e., PF, 
assessed by the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO).
STIPO and the Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV (SCID-I and 
-II) were administered to 206 BPD patients. The relationship between PO and BPD 
components were studied using Spearman correlations and independent linear 
regression analyses.
Significant positive correlations were observed between STIPO scores 
and several DSM-5 BPD criteria and comorbid psychiatric disorders. STIPO 
dimensions mainly correlated with disturbed relatedness and, to a lesser extent, 
affective dysregulation components. Each BPD clinical component was associated 
with specific STIPO dimensions.
Both diagnostic models, DSM-5 BPD criteria and PO, are not only 
related but complementary concepts. The results of this study particularly 
recommend STIPO for the assessment of relational functioning, which is a major 
domain of the Personality Functioning Scale Levels of the DSM-5 AMPD.
