The review of literature over the last decade addresses the impact of childhood 
abuse and neglect on the further development of addictions and mental disorders. 
The results of the studies have been analyzed in the aspect of abuse, age and 
gender characteristics in childhood and variants of consequences: from 
neurodevelopment to behavioral disorders. Childhood abuse and neglect is 
associated with the higher risk of posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal 
behavior and some psychiatric diseases. Attention is focused on the fact that 
adults with substance use disorders (SUDs) report higher rates of child abuse 
than adults without SUDs. The problem demands further investigation to find 
possible predictors of substance use disorders in patients who had experienced 
stressful life events in childhood.
