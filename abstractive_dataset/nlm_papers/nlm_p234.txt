Patients with panic-related anxiety often initially present to the 
emergency department (ED) complaining of respiratory or cardiac symptoms, but 
rates of detection of panic symptoms by ED physicians remain low. This study was 
undertaken to evaluate the relevance of panic attacks and panic disorder in ED 
patients who present with cardiopulmonary symptoms and to determine whether a 
brief symptom-based tool could be constructed to assist in rapid recognition of 
panic-related anxiety in the ED setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: English-speaking adult ED patients with a chief complaint 
of palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, or difficulty breathing were evaluated 
for the presence of panic attacks and panic disorder with the Structured 
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. Participants completed 
self-report measures to assess panic-related symptoms, comorbid psychiatric 
conditions, health-related disability, and health service use.
In this sample (N=200), 23.5% had panic attacks and 23.0% had panic 
disorder. Both groups reported higher rates of panic attack symptoms, greater 
psychiatric comorbidity, greater health-related disability, and higher rates of 
ED and mental health service use compared with those without either condition. A 
brief 7-item tool consisting of panic symptoms identified patients with panic 
attacks or panic disorder with 85% accuracy (area under the curve=0.90, 
sensitivity=82%, specificity=88%).
Patients with panic attacks or panic disorder commonly present to 
the ED, but often go unrecognized. A brief 7-item clinician rating scale 
accurately identifies these patients among those ED patients presenting with 
cardiopulmonary complaints.
