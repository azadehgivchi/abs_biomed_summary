Dual diagnosis (substance use disorder combined with a comorbid 
mental illness) is a common problem. One of the methods to treat this is 
integrated dual diagnosis treatment (IDDT). IDDT consists of the simultaneous, 
integrated application of different treatment components. Their efficacy, 
however, has only been studied separately. As a result, the effectiveness of the 
IDDT program as a whole remains unclear.
To evaluate the scientific evidence relevant to the effectiveness of IDDT 
in dual diagnosis patients.
A systematic literature review using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO 
(Prisma guideline).
RESULTS: Six studies were found: a randomised controlled study (RCT), two 
non-randomised controlled studies, and three uncontrolled pre-post studies . 
There was a notably large diversity in outcome measures. The results differed 
significantly, including some studies concluding a significant (additional) 
effect, while others concluded that there was no indication of a significant 
effect of IDDT.
In clinical practice, IDDT is recommended and chosen frequently as 
the treatment for patients with dual diagnosis. However, it is remarkable how 
limited and unthorough the research is pertaining to the effects of the full 
IDDT program on dual diagnosis.
