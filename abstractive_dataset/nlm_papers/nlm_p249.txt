materialism. Interviews with nurses were conducted using semi-structured script.

knowing, a movement that revealed two categories: clinic of psychiatric nursing, 
and alienation and subordination of nurse in the care process.

therapeutic relationship, favors integral care towards the patient, whereas 
alienation/subordination distances the nurse from care and impairs care.
