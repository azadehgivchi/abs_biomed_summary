The concept of precision medicine, also referred to as individualized or 
personalized medicine, has recently gained traction in scientific, medical, and 
public spheres, and is frequently mentioned as the next model of healthcare 
delivery. Its goal is to integrate unique information obtained from a given 
patient to customize the care provided to achieve the best possible outcome. 
Although precision medicine is not fully implemented yet, its application is 
slowly infiltrating clinical practice, and the dream of individualizing 
healthcare to each patient is now closer to being fulfilled. This chapter 
summarizes the current status of personalized medicine in the neurology clinic, 
including precision diagnostics and individualized therapeutics. Subsequently, 
we address the main hurdles that the healthcare community needs to overcome to 
expand this model of healthcare delivery and predict how this evolving field 
will shape future neurologic practice.
