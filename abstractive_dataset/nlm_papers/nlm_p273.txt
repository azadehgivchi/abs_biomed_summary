The Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB) performs rapid autopsies of donors who gave 
written informed consent during life for the use of their brain tissue and 
medical files for research. The NBB initiated the Netherlands Brain Bank for 
Psychiatry (NBB-Psy), a prospective donor program for psychiatric diseases. 
NBB-Psy wants to expand the tissue collections in order to provide a strong 
incentive to increase research in psychiatry. The ultimate goal of NBB-Psy is to 
reduce the burden of psychiatric disorders for patients, their families, and for 
society as a whole. NBB-Psy consists of an antemortem and postmortem donor 
program. This chapter focuses on the design of NBB-Psy and the antemortem donor 
program, where patients and relatives are actively informed on the possibility 
to become a brain donor. Since the initiation of NBB-Psy, the number of 
registered donors with a psychiatric diagnosis has increased from 149 in 2010 to 
1018 in May 2016.
