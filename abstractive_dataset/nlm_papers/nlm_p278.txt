The symptom "delusions" is a central psychopathological symptom in 
psychiatric diseases. Since the beginning of psychiatry various disciplines have 
attempted to explain and understand delusions but even now no generally accepted 
definition of this phenomenon exists.
A comprehensive review of current psychopathological and neurobiological 
theories of delusions is given.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed and Google scholar searches were performed using 
the keywords "delusion", "psychodynamic" and "neurobiology", both in English and 
German. Relevant German textbooks of psychiatry were also included.
A differentiated perspective of the phenomenon of delusions appears 
to be necessary to approach this complex and fascinating symptom. A 
one-dimensional approach does not do justice to the complexity of delusions. The 
various explanatory approaches can increasingly be linked to each other and are 
no longer considered to be mutually exclusive.
