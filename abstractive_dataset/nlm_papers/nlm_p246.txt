The aim of this study was to evaluate the disease history, treatment 
adherence, and the criminal history of individuals who committed a homicide 
offence, with no criminal responsibility due to their psychiatric illness 
Of 197 who had been released from our forensic psychiatric clinic after 
one-year-mandatory inpatient treatment, we evaluated 160 patients whom we were 
able to contact. To determine the severity of the crimes, criminal violence 
rating scale was used. The sociodemographic characterictics and certain 
variables associated with the disease and the criminal acts of the individuals 
were documented.
Out of 160 patients, 48 had committed serious homicidal crime while 112 
had committed milder or moderate crimes. All homicidal offenders were male. Most 
were single or divorced, living in metropolitan areas. 29.2% were unemployed. Of 
the homicidal offenders, 89.6% had a legal guardian, 93.8% had social insurance, 
83.3% had psychiatric disorder with psychotic features. 29.2% of homicide 
offenders had criminal history even prior to the mandatory treatment, most of 
which were severe violent criminal offenses targeting directly a victim's life.
Among homicidal offenders, diagnosis of schizophrenia and other 
psychotic disorders were more and psychiatric comorbidities were less prevalent. 
The correlation of homicide and unemployment points to the importance of 
occupational rehabilitation. Identifying preventive factors and determining the 
risk of the homicidal behavior in individuals with mental disorders are 
important for the protection of both the patient and the public.
