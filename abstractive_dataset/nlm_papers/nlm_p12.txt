Pediatric heart failure is a complex, heterogenous syndrome that occurs relatively rarely in children, but carries a high burden of morbidity and mortality. This article reflects on the current state of medical therapy for both acute and chronic pediatric heart failure, based on expert consensus guidelines, and the extrapolation of data from trials performed in adults. For the management of acute heart failure specifically, we rely on an initial assessment of the perfusion and volume status of a patient, to guide medical therapy. This paradigm was adapted from adult studies that demonstrated increased morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients whose hemodynamics or examination findings were consistent with a PCWP >18 mmHg and a CI â‰¤2.2 L/min/m2. The cornerstone of treatment in the acute setting therefore relies on achieving a euvolemic state with adequate cardiac output. In the chronic setting, patients are typically maintained on a regimen of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and spironolactone. For those with refractory heart failure, intravenous milrinone therapy has become a mainstay of bridging children to cardiac transplantation. The pediatric-specific data driving these clinical practices are limited and often times, conflicting. The future of pediatric heart failure depends on collaboration, quality improvement, and a commitment to pediatric-specific indications for new medical and device therapies.
