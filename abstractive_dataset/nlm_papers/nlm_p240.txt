Despite discrete autism-related dimensions, such as deficits in 
communication, empathy and mentalizing are likely to affect the development of 
personality and despite they actually frequently occur in borderline patients, 
no research has so far investigated the relationship between autistic traits and 
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The objective of this study is to 
investigate the clinical significance of autistic traits in subjects with BPD.
The sample included 50 patients with a clinical diagnosis of BPD and 69 
healthy controls. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Clinician Version 
was used to establish the presence of comorbid mental disorders among BPD 
subjects and to confirm the absence of lifetime mental disorders in the control 
group. Participants were also asked to fill three self-report instruments: the 
Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), the Autism Spectrum Quotient 
(AQ) and the Mood Spectrum Self-Report (MOODS-SR).
Patients with BPD reported higher autistic traits than healthy 
individuals. Moreover, autistic traits were shown to exert a significant impact 
on some clinical features and associated manifestation of BPD, such as 
suicidality and lifetime exposure to physical and/or sexual abuse.
Subthreshold autism spectrum may be relevant for subjects suffering 
from BPD and future research may further address clinical correlates of autistic 
traits among patients with this disorder.
