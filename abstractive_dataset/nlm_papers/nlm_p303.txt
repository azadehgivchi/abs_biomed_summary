Most working-age adults with psychiatric disabilities are not 
employed yet are interested in being in employment. This goal is achievable for 
the majority who are interested, with the help of international evidence-based 
practices in vocational rehabilitation. However, these practices are not widely 
available in developed countries.
To identify whether, and how, the availability of evidence-based 
vocational rehabilitation is linked to government policy.
A systematic examination of New Zealand's economic and social policy 
context to understand how it facilitates or hinders evidence-based vocational 
rehabilitation for people with psychiatric disabilities.
The New Zealand policy context is currently hindering the availability 
of evidence-based vocational rehabilitation for people with psychiatric 
disabilities. Whilst policy reform has commenced, it has not yet translated into 
a purchasing framework free of policy conflicts and barriers. Consequently, the 
proportion of people with psychiatric disabilities not employed and not 
participating in the labor market is increasing.
Adopting the policy adjustments identified could expand the 
availability of evidence-based vocational rehabilitation, reducing the disparity 
between individual vocational goals and actual labor force activity. This in 
turn could have national social and economic benefits through reduced welfare 
dependence, reduced health service utilization, and increased labor force 
participation.
