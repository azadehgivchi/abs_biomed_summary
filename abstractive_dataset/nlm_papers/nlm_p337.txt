In this study, we aimed to retrospectively assess the correlation of 
pseudocholinesterase (PChE) levels with age, gender, body weight and diagnosed 
psychiatric diseases in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) cases. Methods: This 
retrospective study was conducted at Bülent Ecevit University Hospital, 
Zonguldak, Turkey, between 2007 and 2011. In the study, 193 ECT case files were 
retrospectively scanned to evaluate PChE values before ECT and other file 
information.  Results: There was no difference between gender in terms of PChE 
levels. Correlation analysis determined a weakly positive correlation between 
age (p=0.013; correlation coefficient [cc]: 0.178) and body weight (p less 
than 0.001; cc: 0.273) and PChE levels. No correlation was found between age, 
gender, weight or psychiatric diagnosis, and PChE levels.  Conclusion: 
Neuromuscular blockage is a significant factor that increases patient safety, 
while increasing the efficacy of ECT. In choosing muscle relaxant agents, both 
patient factors and the pharmacological properties of the neuromuscular blocker 
should be considered. We think that in situations with delayed recovery of ECT 
cases without identified PChE levels, low PChE levels must be considered.
