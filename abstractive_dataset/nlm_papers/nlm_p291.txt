Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is chronic psychiatric disorder associated 
with high rates of functional impairment and decreased quality of life. Although 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of 
OCD, little data is available to guide clinicians on how to manage these 
medications long-term. Cognitive-behavioral approaches provide a promising 
avenue for helping OCD patients discontinue maintenance SRIs while minimizing 
the potential for symptom worsening. This manuscript describes the rationale and 
methods for pilot feasibility study designed to a unified, cognitive-behavioral 
strategy for discontinuing long-term SRIs in OCD. The aims of the study are (1) 
to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of research procedures and 
interventions, (2) to test the efficacy of this treatment relative to an 
enhanced control condition and (3) to investigate the role of distress tolerance 
in both taper completion and clinical outcome. Our central aim is to investigate 
whether this approach improves discontinue outcomes relative to an enhanced 
control condition. Identifying optimal long-term treatment strategies for this 
population is needed to guide clinicians managing this often-chronic disorder.
