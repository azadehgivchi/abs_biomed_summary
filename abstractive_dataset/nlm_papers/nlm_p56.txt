Sleep deprivation (SD) is a common condition that afflicts many people in modern life. Deficits in daytime performance due to SD are experienced universally. Recent evidence indicates that SD causes impairments in cognitive functions. However, the mechanisms that SD impairs cognitive functions are not clear. This review will focus on the behavioral and neural effects of SD with the aim to elucidate the possible mechanisms of SD-induced deterioration in cognitive functions and to identify directions for future research.
