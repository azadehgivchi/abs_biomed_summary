Digital media (also called "new media") have become an important ecosystem in which adolescents develop biologically, psychologically, and socially. When assessing adolescents in the psychiatric interview, a nuanced understanding of digital media use can inform a more accurate formulation. However, there are few published resources to help the psychiatrist assess the impact of digital media during the initial adolescent interview. The authors propose an innovation on the traditional psychiatric assessment that addresses teen Internet use and digital media habits. Through this enhanced assessment, mental health clinicians can improve upon current interviewing practices of twenty-first century adolescents.
