Sleep disturbance plays a significant role in cognitive impairment 
following traumatic brain injury (TBI).
To summarize recent findings that examine sleep disturbance and 
cognition in TBI.
Epidemiological information on sleep disorders in people with TBI is 
presented. A simple introduction to the role of sleep in normal cognition 
provides context for the literature on clinical populations. Current theory on 
the mechanisms underlying cognitive problems in people with sleep disorder is 
briefly described. Findings on the relationship between sleep disorder and 
cognitive problems in TBI is examined in more detail.
RESULTS: Consistent reports of an association between sleep duration and 
cognition include several studies noting positive associations (shorter sleep 
duration accompanies cognitive impairment) and others observing negative 
associations (longer sleep duration accompanies cognitive problems). Both 
insomnia and hypersomnolence are forms of sleep disturbance that disrupt key 
mental processes such as memory consolidation. Obstructive sleep apnea, cerebral 
structural abnormalities, neurochemical changes and psychiatric pathology are 
implicated.
Additional information is needed on how severity of injury impacts 
sleep and cognition. Hypothesized mechanisms underlying the effects of sleep on 
cognition in TBI should be empirically tested. Further, discrepancies between 
objective and subjective measures of sleep and cognition must be explored.
