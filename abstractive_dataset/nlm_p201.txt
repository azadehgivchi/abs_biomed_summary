This article summarises the current evidence on the risk of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) with the use of antipsychotics. An increasing number of 
observational studies indicate an elevated risk of VTE in antipsychotic drug 
users. Although the use of certain antipsychotics has been associated with VTE, 
current data can neither conclusively verify differences in occurrence rates of 
VTE between first- and second-generation antipsychotics or between individual 
compounds, nor identify which antipsychotic drugs have the lowest risk of VTE. 
The biological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this adverse drug 
reaction are still to be clarified but hypotheses such as drug-induced sedation, 
obesity, increased levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, enhanced platelet 
aggregation, hyperhomocysteinaemia and hyperprolactinaemia have been suggested. 
Risk factors associated with the underlying psychiatric disorder may at least 
partly explain the increased risk. Physicians should be aware of this 
potentially serious and even sometimes fatal adverse drug reaction and should 
consider discontinuing or switching the antipsychotic treatment in patients 
experiencing a VTE. Even though supporting evidence is limited, prophylactic 
antithrombotic treatment should be considered in risk situations for VTE.
