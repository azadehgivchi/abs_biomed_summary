Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are the most common 
mood disorders. They are etiologically related, but clinically distinct 
psychiatric illnesses. Their shared clinical features result in high rates of 
misdiagnosis due to a lack of biomarkers that allow their differentiation. BD is 
more frequently misdiagnosed as MDD because of overlapping symptomology, often 
later onset of mania, and frequent occurrence of depressive episodes in patients 
with BD. Misdiagnosis is also increased when patients with BD present symptoms 
indicative of a clinically significant depressive episode, but are premorbid for 
manic symptoms, or previous manic states not recognized. Therefore, the 
development of specific biomarkers for these disorders would be invaluable for 
establishing the correct diagnosis and treatment of MDD and BD. This chapter 
presents an overview and future perspective of the identification of biomarkers 
for mood disorders using metabolomics.
