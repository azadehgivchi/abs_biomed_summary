Adverse experiences during sensitive postnatal developmental periods can disrupt 
the calibration of fundamental systems and increase the risk of a wide range of 
adult disease states, including psychiatric illnesses. Accumulating evidence 
suggests that epigenetic modifications involving DNA methylation, 
posttranslational histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs may be a key 
mediating factor in this disruption. Accumulating evidence from both animal 
models and human studies suggests that early life adversity alters the epigenome 
at multiple loci across the genome, but that the specific alterations, and the 
associated transcriptomic and psychiatric outcomes may be dependent on multiple 
individual factors. Here we will review the current findings on early life 
adversity associated alterations of the epigenome in animal models and humans, 
discuss current limitations, and highlight possible solutions and future 
directions.
