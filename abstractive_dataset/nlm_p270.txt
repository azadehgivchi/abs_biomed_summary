BACKGROUND: Although there is a great need for staging and profiling in 
psychiatry, no-one has so far devised a staging and profiling model to aid 
diagnosis and treatment.
AIM: To devise a basic staging and profiling strategy that can be used to treat 
patients suffering from both substance abuse disorder and a psychiatric 
disorder.
METHOD: On the basis of existing staging model for addiction, we explore how 
staging could also be useful for the treatment of comorbidity in psychiatry.
RESULTS: Since there is hardly any evidence of the use of staging for this kind 
of comorbidity, we present a staging model that might help to provide a 
solution. To the described stages we add a recommended treatment setting or 
treatment intensity.
CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to ascertain whether the staging model 
that we have presented will lead to improvements in the prognosis and treatment 
of patients with dual disorders referred to Dutch psychiatrists.
