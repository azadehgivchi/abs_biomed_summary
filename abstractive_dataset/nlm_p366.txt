Almost all patients requiring care for a combination of sexual, physiological, 
and psychological trauma, suffer from psychological or mental illness. Mental 
symptoms are well known to be associated with the violence very well and 
assailants have a violence dependency but it is not a well known mental disease. 
Changing of roles between being an assailant and being a victim is observed in 
half of the patients. In patients with trauma, hyperarousal and apathy appears 
simultaneously, and avoidance symptoms, intrusion symptoms, and crashed sleep, 
dissociation are also recognized. In addition, symptoms of orality are observed 
in patients requiring trauma care. However, hyperarousal, disturbance of sleep, 
and suicidal ideation improve quickly and the symptoms of a pair of a 
mother-child pair are well correlated. In organic non-temporary hyper 
psychogenic diseases (physiological diseases and surgery, and so on), 
non-organic psychogenic diseases (psychiatric diseases), and diseases on the 
border line between organic and non-organic diseases (psychosomatic diseases and 
may be unknown to non-medical professionals knowledge of such characteristic 
symptoms) is important information for health and medical care in the regional 
comprehensive care setting.
