Recently, a dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has 
been included in the DSM-5. This review focuses on the clinical and 
neurobiological features that distinguish the dissociative subtype of PTSD from 
non-dissociative PTSD. Clinically, the dissociative subtype of PTSD is 
associated with high PTSD severity, predominance of derealization and 
depersonalization symptoms, a more significant history of early life trauma, and 
higher levels of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, PTSD patients with 
dissociative symptoms exhibit different psychophysiological and neural responses 
to the recall of traumatic memories. While individuals with non-dissociative 
PTSD exhibit an increased heart rate, decreased activation of prefrontal 
regions, and increased activation of the amygdala in response to traumatic 
reminders, individuals with the dissociative subtype of PTSD show an opposite 
pattern. It has been proposed that dissociation is a regulatory strategy to 
restrain extreme arousal in PTSD through hyperinhibition of limbic regions. In 
this research update, promises and pitfalls in current research studies on the 
dissociative subtype of PTSD are listed. Inclusion of the dissociative subtype 
of PTSD in the DSM-5 stimulates research on the prevalence, symptomatology, and 
neurobiology of the dissociative subtype of PTSD and poses a challenge to 
improve treatment outcome in PTSD patients with dissociative symptoms.
