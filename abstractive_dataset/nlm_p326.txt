OBJECTIVE: There have been significant reductions in numbers of psychiatric beds 
and length of stay (LOS) worldwide, making LOS in psychiatric beds an 
interesting outcome. The objective of this study was to find factors measurable 
on admission that would predict LOS in the acute psychiatric setting.
METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study.
RESULTS: Overall, 385 subjects were included. The median LOS was 25 days. In the 
final model, six variables explained 14.6% of the variation in LOS: not having 
own income, psychiatric admissions in the preceding 2 years, high Clinical 
Global Impression and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores, diagnosis of 
schizophrenia, and history of attempted suicide. All variables were associated 
with longer LOS, apart from history of attempted suicide.
CONCLUSIONS: Identifying patients who will need to stay longer in psychiatric 
beds remains a challenge. Improving knowledge about determinants of LOS could 
lead to improvements in the quality of care in hospital psychiatry.
