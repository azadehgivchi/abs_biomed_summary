OBJECTIVE: To the best of our knowledge, the mental health status of physically 
injured Syrian refugees has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was 
to examine the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity among physically injured 
Syrian refugees in Turkey receiving treatment at the main rehabilitation centre 
near the Syrian border.
METHOD: This is a cross sectional study. Information was collected from 
consenting injured Syrian refugees at Dar-el-Shefa'a Hospital in ReyhanlÄ± 
(Turkey) during a one week period in December 2012 and another one week period 
in August 2013. A clinical psychiatric interview was conducted to determine a 
diagnosis according to the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV-TR.
RESULTS: A total of 40 refugees consented and completed a clinical psychiatric 
interview. All refugees in this study did not have a significant past 
psychiatric history. The most prevalent current diagnosis was major depressive 
disorder (22.5%), adjustment disorder (20%), and post-traumatic stress disorder 
(15%). Five (12.5%) patients had no evidence of a psychiatric disorder.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity among injured Syrian 
refugees in our study was extremely high. This may help guide the treatment and 
management of this select population.
LIMITATIONS: This study had a low number of participants. The method of 
assessment was not standardized with a validated tool.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study may help guide the treatment and management of 
this select population, both in neighbouring countries and as resettled refugees 
in Western host countries.
