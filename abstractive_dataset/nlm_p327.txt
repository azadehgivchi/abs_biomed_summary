OBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy is one of the primary treatments for psychiatric 
disorders. Given the variation in individual response, a more personalized 
approach is needed. This paper will discuss methods for user-friendly referrals, 
recruitment criteria, data storage and dissemination, biological sample and 
clinical questionnaire collection, and advertising.
METHODS: The Individualized Medicine: Pharmacogenetics Assessment and Clinical 
Treatment (IMPACT) study is one of the first to use pharmacogenetic testing on a 
large scale in psychiatry as a tool to predict individual drug response and 
tolerability. As IMPACT's eligibility criteria includes all diagnoses and 
comorbidities, the participant population will reflect the diversity amongst 
mental health consumers. IMPACT's innovative study design will demonstrate the 
utility of this testing within the health care system.
RESULTS: IMPACT has successfully implemented pharmacogenetic testing on a 
relatively large scale, and in both tertiary level and primary care settings. It 
represents a novel approach to psychiatric care and from its initial stages the 
design has evolved to accommodate the nature and needs of the health care 
community.
CONCLUSION: It is anticipated that IMPACT will continue to demonstrate the 
feasibility of pharmacogenetic testing and facilitate its introduction and 
implementation in routine healthcare practice.
