Our understanding of the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders remains limited, 
and biomarker-based clinical management is yet to be developed. Induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has revolutionized our capacity to 
generate patient-derived neurons to model psychiatric disorders. Here, we 
highlight advantages and caveats of iPSC disease modeling and outline strategies 
for addressing current challenges.
