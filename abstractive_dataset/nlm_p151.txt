Insomnia is a common feature of many psychiatric disorders but can also be a 
comorbid disorder, often contributing to poor outcomes and treatment failure. 
For some patients who do respond to psychiatric treatment, their insomnia 
persists after their mood symptoms have remitted, indicating that their insomnia 
needs to be a separate focus of treatment. In this CME Academic Highlights, Drs 
Ruth Benca and Daniel Buysse discuss how to effectively evaluate patients with 
psychiatric disorders for comorbid insomnia, as well as how to safely and 
effectively implement both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments. ​​​​​​​
