PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As personality disorder impacts the outcome of most major 
mental disorders, it would be consistent for it to impact negatively on the 
outcome of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). This update is to provide an up-to-date 
overview of the recent literature examining the impact of personality disorder 
and personality traits on the treatment outcome of AUDs.
RECENT FINDINGS: Comorbidity between personality disorder and AUD is significant 
and approaches 50%. Patients with AUD and comorbid personality disorder are 
substantially less likely to remain in treatment, drink more per drinking day 
and drink more frequently. If retained in treatment, comorbidity does not, 
however, lead to poorer outcomes. Relapse to drinking is more common in patient 
with high novelty seeking and lower reward dependence and persistence. Reporting 
from most studies is of moderate-to-poor quality and a single high-quality study 
may alter these findings. Landmark alcohol studies are notably quiet on the 
impact of personality on AUD treatment outcome.
SUMMARY: Both personality disorder and higher novelty seeking impact negatively 
on the treatment outcome of AUD. As personality disorder is common in this 
group, clinicians engaged in AUD treatment should screen for personality 
disturbance, either disorder or high novelty seeking.
