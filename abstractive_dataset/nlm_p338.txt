Sleeping pills are one of the most common drugs taken by adults when afflicted 
by insomnia. Adverse effects of pharmacotherapy, however, should not be 
overlooked, and monitoring is needed to check for an overdose of sleeping pills. 
We reviewed zolpidem overdose and patient suicide with benefits and 
disadvantages of pharmacotherapy. Cases of adverse effects concerning the 
central nervous system, including delirium and hallucination, as well as 
abnormal behavior during sleep, are commonly reported among patients who have 
taken zolpidem for more than 1 year. The serious problem of long-term 
prescription to medication can lead to a higher mortality rate of insomniac 
patients. An alternative to medication for treating insomnia is cognitive 
behavioral therapy, which can improve sleeping habits. Cognitive behavioral 
therapy induces patients to recognize and change the negative thoughts that 
affect their sleep. Medical providers should be aware of the adverse effects of 
sleep inducers and provide sufficient information to their patients about them. 
When establishing treatment plans, they should encourage patients to make the 
proper decisions and try to reduce the adverse effects of any medication as much 
as possible.
