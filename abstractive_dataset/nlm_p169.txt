The landscape of American health care is changing under the weight of new 
knowledge that health care workers-physicians, nurses, and so on-are abusing the 
drugs that they use within health care. In this article, the author uses 
ethnographic data (including his own work in American pharmacies over the past 
two decades) to contextualize how health care's drug abuse epidemic is racially 
coded to ignore the fact that White Americans are the primary drug abusers-what 
he calls "redpilling." In pointing out the racial contexts of health care's drug 
abuse, the author asks whether our national "war on drugs" ought to be recast to 
see how White racial privilege-the privilege of White Americans to comfortably 
perform certain actions (and get away with them if they are illegal or morally 
wrong)-mandates that we move the lens of drug policy from ghettos and ethnic 
communities to American health care where we have been historically positioned 
to not identify White American health care workers who work while high.
