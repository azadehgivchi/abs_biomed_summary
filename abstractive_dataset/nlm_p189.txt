OBJECTIVE: Stroke is a major public health problem worldwide, and its 
neuropsychiatric sequelae are frequent and disabling. Furthermore, there is 
evidence that these sequelae impair recovery. Brazil has the highest stroke 
rates in Latin America, but data on the frequency of neuropsychiatric disorders 
in these patients are scarce. This study aimed to identify mental disorders 
among in-hospital patients with acute ischemic stroke.
METHODS: The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus (MINI-Plus) was 
applied to 60 patients during the first week of hospitalization.
RESULTS: Psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 55% of the patients. A wide 
range of neuropsychiatric disorders have been identified, mainly mood and 
anxiety disorders. Specifically, we identified major depression (26.7%), alcohol 
abuse or dependence (11.7%), specific phobia (8.3%), generalized anxiety 
disorder (6.7%), psychosis (5.0%), social phobia (3.3%), adjustment disorder 
(3.3%) and panic disorder (1.7%).
CONCLUSION: Psychiatric comorbidity should be evaluated as part of the 
rehabilitation of stroke patients and should be carefully examined by 
physicians.
