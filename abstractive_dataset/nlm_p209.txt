BACKGROUND: Despite that the epidemiological studies on the comorbidity of 
alcohol misuse and psychiatric disorders have been studied, less is known about 
the magnitude of these disorders among patients with alcoholic liver disease 
(ALD). Our aim was to determine the prevalence of psychiatric and substance use 
disorders among hospitalized ALD patients in the United States.
METHODS: We utilized a single-level clinical classification software to identify 
patients with ALD and psychiatric/substance use disorders from the 2011 National 
Inpatient Sample data. The primary outcome was the prevalence of these disorders 
among hospitalized patients with ALD (n = 74,972) compared to those with chronic 
liver diseases not caused by alcohol (n = 350,140) and those without underlying 
liver diseases (n = 1,447,063).
RESULTS: The prevalence of adjustment disorder, anxiety disorder, posttraumatic 
stress disorder, and depression was significantly higher among hospitalized 
patients with ALD when compared to those with chronic liver diseases not caused 
by alcohol (all with p-values <0.05). Younger age, female gender, and White race 
were the independent predictors of psychiatric/substance use disorders among 
hospitalized patients with ALD.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with ALD have significantly high prevalence 
of concomitant psychiatric and substance abuse disorders when compared to those 
with chronic liver diseases not caused by alcohol and those without underlying 
liver diseases. Screening and appropriate intervention should be implemented as 
part of routine clinical care for these patients.
