Euthymic bipolar disorder (BD) has been associated with subtle impairment in 
face processing. However, it is not known whether their difficulties extend to 
the processing of gaze. In the present study, two tasks, both of which rely on 
the ability to make use of the eye region of a pictured face, were used: the 
Reading the Mind in the Eyes test and the Eye-gaze cueing task. Compared to 
healthy controls, BD patients were impaired at judging mental state from images 
of the face but showed normal susceptibility to the direction of gaze as an 
attentional cue. These findings suggest that BD patients present selective gaze 
processing impairment, limited to the sensitivity to intention and emotion. This 
impairment could account at least partially for the higher levels of 
interpersonal problems generally observed in BD.
