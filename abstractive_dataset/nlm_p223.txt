General practitioners (GP), on the frontline for individuals with mental health 
problems, often deal with work-related common psychiatric disorders. We aimed to 
determine the prevalence of work-related common psychiatric disorders in general 
practice and associated patients' and GPs' characteristics. HERACLES, a 
cross-sectional study among 2019 working patients of 121 GPs in the Nord - 
Pas-de-Calais region in France. Common psychiatric disorders were assessed using 
the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, patient-perceived 
psychological distress and GP-diagnosed psychiatric disorders. The 
work-relatedness of common psychiatric disorders was ascertained by the GP 
and/or the patient. Prevalence rates adjusted on age were calculated by sex and 
associated characteristics were ascertained using multilevel Poisson regression 
models. The prevalence of work-related common psychiatric disorders ascertained 
using the MINI was estimated at 25.6% [23.7-27.5], 24.5% [22.6-26.4] for 
self-reported psychological distress and 25.8% [23.9-27.7] for GP-diagnosed 
psychiatric disorders. Age, history of psychiatric disorders, consultation for 
psychological purpose and GP's characteristics were associated with 
MINI-identified psychiatric disorders. The prevalence of work-related common 
psychiatric disorders among working adults seen in general practice is high but 
further studies are needed to support this results.
