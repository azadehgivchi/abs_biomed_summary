Psychologic and social effects of scalp hair are more important than its biologic significance. Etiology of alopecia areata (AA) suggests a predominantly autoimmune reaction. Correlation between AA and psychologic disorders is reciprocal. Psychiatric disorders can trigger the onset of AA and its negative consequences may develop or exacerbate psychologic problems. The high incidence of a neurotic personality, depression, anxiety, and deficiency in coping with stress strengthen the role of psychic factors in the pathogenesis of AA. Strategies to assess these patients are often not apparent for the clinician and identifying patients in need of extra psychologic support should be a mainstay for successful treatment. Women, young patients, and those with significant AA or previous psychiatric disorders are at greater risk, requiring careful monitoring. Proper awareness and consciousness about the close relationship between AA and psychologic factors are essential.
