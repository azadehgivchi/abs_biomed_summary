Aggressive behavior is observed in a significant number of patients with 
epilepsy. The aggressive behavior is associated with structural and functional 
changes in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and striatum. From the clinical 
point of view, aggressive behavior more often is not related to the seizure, and 
develops as part of borderline psychiatric disorder. Another potential cause of 
aggressive behavior is postictal psychotic disorder. Pre- and intraictal 
aggressive behavior is rarely observed. Anticonvulsants may influence 
differently on aggression. Antidepressants, neuroleptics, normotimics and 
psychotherapy are used in correction of aggression.
