The U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) has created a metasearch engine called the NLM Gateway at the URL "gateway.nlm.nih.gov". The Gateway allows the user to issue one search that takes place on multiple NLM retrieval engines. A composite result set is presented in several categories of information: journal citations; books, serials and audiovisuals; consumer health; meeting abstracts; and other collections.
