BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is great interest, supported by clinical 
experience, in the relationship between Eating Disorders (EDs) and psychiatric 
symptoms and diseases. The psychopathology of EDs is also referred to many risk 
and protective factors, and there is some evidence in the literature, also about 
genetic and neurobiological factors involved. The aim of this review is to 
examine and synthesize the recent scientific literature on this topic, in 
particular the complex relationship between Anorexia Nervosa and 
Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
METHODS: We analyzed the best of published literature on the topic, identifying 
keywords and MeSH terms in Pubmed and then searching them. The last search was 
performed on November 2017.
RESULTS: Psychiatric comorbidities are very common in anorexia nervosa. Mood 
disorders, major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive 
disorders, developmental disorders among autistic spectrum and attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder and even some personality disorders, substance abuse and 
borderline traits have been reported, and some observations suggest a positive 
genetic correlation between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia.
CONCLUSION: The great amount of scientific articles dealing with the 
relationship between EDs and psychopathology confirms the complexity of these 
problems and the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. An accurate diagnosis 
and assessment of clinical risk about psychological, psychiatric, nutritional 
and somatic aspects are therefore essential for an appropriate therapeutic 
management of patients affected by anorexia nervosa.
