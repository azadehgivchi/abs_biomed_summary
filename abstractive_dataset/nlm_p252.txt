Mental disorders are generally characterized by a combination of abnormal 
thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behavior, and relationships with others. 
Although multiple risk factors, such as genetic and environmental factors and 
interaction of these factors, are suggested, the exact etiologies are not known. 
On the other hand, it has been strongly suggested that the dopaminergic system 
is impaired in a variety of mental disorders. In the described method, the 
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line is differentiated to neuronal cell which 
expresses NSE, neuronal marker, and dopamine transporter (DAT) by treatment with 
all-trans-retinoic acid. SH-SY5Y cells allow investigating neuronal phenotypes 
of mental disorders as an in vitro model of these disorders.
