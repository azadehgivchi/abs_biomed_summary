BACKGROUND: Comorbid anxiety disorders and childhood maltreatment have each been 
linked with unfavourable outcomes in people with bipolar disorder. Because 
childhood maltreatment is associated with anxiety disorders in this population, 
their respective predictive value remains to be determined.
METHODS: In 174 adults with bipolar disorder, we assessed childhood maltreatment 
using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and lifetime anxiety disorders with the 
MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. We constructed an overall index 
of severity of bipolar disorder as a sum of six indicators (unemployment, 
psychotic symptoms, more than five manic episodes, more than five depressive 
episodes, suicide attempt, and hospital admission). We tested the relationship 
between childhood maltreatment, the number of anxiety disorders and the overall 
severity index using ordered logistic regression.
RESULTS: The number of lifetime anxiety disorders was associated with the 
overall severity index (OR = 1.43, 95%CI = 1.01-2.04, p = 0.047). This 
relationship was only slightly attenuated when controlled for childhood 
maltreatment (OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 0.97-2.00, p = 0.069). The relationship between 
childhood maltreatment and the overall severity index was not statistically 
significant (OR = 1.26, 95%CI = 0.92-1.74, p = 0.151). Secondary analyses 
revealed that childhood maltreatment was associated with suicide attempts (OR = 
1.70, 95%CI = 1.15-2.51, p = 0.008) and obsessive compulsive disorder was 
associated with the overall severity index (OR = 9.56, 95%CI = 2.20-41.47, p = 
0.003).
LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study with a moderate-sized sample 
recruited from a specialist program.
CONCLUSIONS: While comorbid anxiety disorders are associated with the overall 
severity of bipolar disorder, childhood maltreatment is specifically associated 
with suicide attempts. Clinicians should systematically assess both factors. 
Interventions to improve outcomes of people with bipolar disorder with comorbid 
anxiety disorders and history of childhood maltreatment are needed.
