A 12-year-old girl with no psychiatric history developed psychotic symptoms, 
including formal thought disorder and delusional ideas after omeprazole was 
initiated. Given the co-occurrence of omeprazole initiation and the start of 
these symptoms, omeprazole was discontinued and replaced by ranitidine which led 
to immediate symptom reduction followed by complete remission. Although the 
proton pump inhibitor (ppi) omeprazole is considered safe and is commonly 
prescribed, it can cause rare major psychiatric side-effects. Despite conducting 
a literature search to uncover a possible causal mechanism to explain these 
side-effects, no conclusive explanatio was found.
