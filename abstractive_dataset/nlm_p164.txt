Psychiatric disorders are debilitating diseases, affecting >80 million people 
worldwide. There are no causal cures for psychiatric disorders and available 
therapies only treat the symptoms. The etiology of psychiatric disorders is 
unknown, although it has been speculated to be a combination of environmental, 
stress and genetic factors. One of the neurotransmitter systems implicated in 
the biology of psychiatric disorders is the purinergic system. In this review, 
we performed a comprehensive search of the literature about the role and 
function of the purinergic system in the development and predisposition to 
psychiatric disorders, with a focus on depression, schizophrenia, bipolar 
disorder, autism, anxiety and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We also 
describe how therapeutics used for psychiatric disorders act on the purinergic 
system.
