While three quarters of all psychiatric disorders develop before the age of 
eighteen, mental health services are barely enlisted by adolescents. This 
population is increasingly targeted by F-ACT youth teams (flexible assertive 
community treatment) in the Netherlands, considering regular mental health 
services often encounter difficulty in reaching out to them. It remains unknown 
how severe their psychopathology can be.<br/> AIM: To describe the adolescents 
being treated in a F-ACT youth team, outlining their problems and needs. To 
answer the question whether youngsters under the age of eighteen can meet the 
criteria of severe mental illness (SMI).<br/> METHOD: An inventory was made of 
all adolescents referred to our F-ACT youth team regarding psychiatric diagnosis 
and limitations in social functioning. Two case reports were included as 
subsequent illustration.<br/> RESULTS: The juvenile population treated by our 
F-ACT youth team (n = 30) were predominantly males (n = 20). They suffered from 
various psychiatric problems, often coinciding with longstanding social 
limitations. Three quarters of these youths could meet the criteria of SMI.<br/> 
CONCLUSION: It was established that a substantial amount of juveniles under the 
age of eighteen meet the criteria of SMI. This could facilitate the provision of 
targeted care for youths. However, there is also the risk of stigmatisation.
