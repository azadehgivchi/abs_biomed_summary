Over the last few decades, evidence has emerged that the pathogenesis of 
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia can involve perturbations of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and other neuroendocrine systems. 
Variations in the manifestation of these effects could be related to differences 
in clinical symptoms between affected individuals and to differences in 
treatment response. Such effects can also arise from the complex interaction 
between genes and environmental factors. Here, we review the effects of maternal 
stress on abnormalities in HPA axis regulation and the development of 
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Studies in this area may prove 
critical for increasing our understanding of the multidimensional nature of 
mental disorders and could lead to the development of improved diagnostics and 
novel therapeutic approaches for treating individuals who suffer from these 
conditions.
