BACKGROUND: The inability to perform productive work due to mental disorders is 
a growing concern in advanced societies.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate medically certified mental disorder and all-cause sick 
leave in a working population using demographic, socioeconomic and occupational 
predictors.
METHODS: The study population was the entire Swedish work force aged 16-64 years 
in December 31st 2011. The outcome was sick leave exceeding 14 days in 2012 with 
adjustment for 13 confounders.
RESULTS: The risk of sick leave with a mental disorder is higher among women 
compared to men, among persons aged 30-39 and among parents in families with 
underage children. Employees in welfare service occupations within health care, 
education and social services have an elevated risk of mental disorder sick 
leave and constitute a large proportion of the workforce.
CONCLUSION: The results support the need for improving early detection and 
prevention of mental disorders in the workforce. Improvements in psychosocial 
work environments are essential, where the higher risk in female dominated 
welfare occupations particularly, have repercussions on the quality of the 
welfare services provided for vulnerable groups in society. Better work-life 
balance in families with younger children could also mitigate the effects of a 
high total workload in that particular phase of life.
