Episodic memory is one of the most significant sources of information of humans. 
It entails cooperative and linguistic skills and, as Mahr & Csibra (M&C) note, 
the capacity to ground veridical beliefs about the past. In some psychiatric 
disorders (antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder), it was found 
that the habit of lying is associated with episodic memory and consciousness 
deficits.
