OBJECTIVE: Circadian rhythm dysfunction has been considered to be common in 
bipolar disorder (BD) and plays an important role in mood dysregulation in this 
disorder. However, no study has investigated whether circadian rhythm 
dysfunction would affect the clinical course of BD. The aim of this study was to 
test the hypothesis that circadian rhythm dysfunction could be a predictor of 
relapse in euthymic BD patients.
METHODS: One hundred four euthymic outpatients with BD diagnosed according to 
the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth 
Edition (DSM-5), participated in this prospective follow-up study from August 
2014 to April 2015. At baseline, data on demographic variables and clinical 
descriptive variables of bipolar disorder were ascertained via clinical 
interviews. The diagnoses of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) were 
made based on participants' sleep logs for 4 weeks and according to the 
International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3). The BD 
symptoms of the subjects were evaluated using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression 
Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores every 4 weeks 
throughout the 48-week study period. Relapse of BD was defined as scores higher 
than the cutoff points (MADRS score ≥ 13 and YMRS score ≥ 7). The primary 
outcome was time to relapse of mood episodes.
RESULTS: Thirty-four subjects met criteria for CRSWD at baseline, most 
frequently delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (n = 27). Of the total 104 
subjects, 51 (49.0%) experienced relapse during the 48-week follow-up period. 
Multivariate Cox hazard regression analyses revealed that 2 or more previous 
mood episodes within the past year and comorbidity of CRSWD were significantly 
associated with the time to relapse of mood episodes (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid CRSWD, mainly delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, could be 
a significant predictor of relapse in BD patients.
