PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent 
and disabling medical conditions worldwide. Despite its considerable burden, our 
understanding of its pathophysiology remains rudimentary, and a validated 
biomarker has yet to be identified. Antidepressants are the most common 
treatment for MDD, yet roughly one-third of patients experience an inadequate 
response. Thus, there is a great need for not only identifying biomarkers of MDD 
but also those that can predict and monitor or just monitor response to 
treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as endogenous fine-tuners and on-off 
switches of gene expression. Several lines of evidence now suggest that miRNAs 
are involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. As such, miRNAs 
offer great hope as biomarkers of disease and response to treatment.
SUMMARY: In this review, we discuss the growing field, investigating peripheral 
miRNAs as potential biomarkers of major depression and treatment response. A 
noninvasive and validated biomarker of MDD or treatment response will help 
clinicians guide treatment selection. Ultimately, these findings provide 
important steps in the development of early diagnostic tools, preventive 
strategies, and effective pharmacological treatment for psychiatric disorders.
