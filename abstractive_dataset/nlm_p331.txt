BACKGROUND: The etiopathogenesis of psychiatric disorders is still not 
completely understood. Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that mental 
illness and related disturbances do not necessarily originate in the brain. 
Inflammation has been suggested to play a central role in psychiatric disorders 
and altered levels of peripheral cytokines have been reported in several 
studies. Recently, it has emerged that bacteria populating the human gut could 
modulate low-grade inflammation, as well as high-order brain functions, 
including mood and behavior. These bacteria constitute the microbiota, a large 
population comprising 40,000 bacterial species and 1,800 phila involved in key 
processes important to maintain body homeostasis.
METHOD: In this review, we present and discuss studies exploring the role of 
dysbiosis and products of the gutmicrobiota in the pathogenesis of psychiatric 
disorders, as well as their potential involvement in mediating the effect of 
antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics.
RESULTS: Although this field is still at its early stage of development, a 
growing number of studies suggest that an altered composition of the gut 
microbiota, together with translocation of bacterial products into the systemic 
circulation, might play a role in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders as 
well as in response to psychotropic medications.
CONCLUSION: An altered composition and functioning of gut microbiota have been 
reported in psychiatric disorders, and recent findings suggest that gut bacteria 
could be involved in modulating the efficacy of psychotropic medications.
