BACKGROUND: This retrospective study evaluated the impact of a psychosocial 
program on individuals with severe and chronic psychiatric disorders. This study 
also examined potential modifiable predictors of hospitalization.
METHODS: The sample was comprised of 94 individuals with severe and chronic 
mental illness who were followed in the Community Support Network (CSN), a 
psychosocial program. Data from initial assessment at admission to the CSN were 
compared with the last assessment after admission, during data abstraction. Data 
were analyzed using analysis of variance for hospitalization, accommodation 
(housing), and employment, and the logistic regression procedure was used to 
analyze the relationship among potential modifiable clinical independent 
variables and hospitalization.
RESULTS: Admission to CSN significantly reduced hospitalization rates. Presence 
of psychotic symptoms increased the likelihood of hospitalization, and the use 
of support groups, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers decreased the risk for 
hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CSN reduced hospitalization rates as well 
as increased employment, and the switch from the Assertive Community Treatment 
program to the Community Support Team program in 2007 did not change this 
effect. The overall significant reduction in psychiatric symptoms could explain 
these positive findings.
