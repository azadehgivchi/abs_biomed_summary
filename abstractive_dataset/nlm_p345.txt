BACKGROUND: Some people who have a mental illness may require vocational 
rehabilitation and support to assist their participation in activity and 
employment. The WORKS is a vocational rehabilitation group intervention program, 
co-facilitated by Peer-Support Workers and Occupational Therapists. These 
facilitators provide support and guidance to people with a mental illness 
through practical activities and goal development.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the lived experiences and perceptions of 
facilitators of The WORKS.
METHODS: The Integrating Theory, Evidence and Action (ITEA) method was used in 
this study, employing a phenomenological approach. Facilitators of The WORKS at 
a metropolitan Australian mental health service were purposively sampled, and 
four participated in semi-structured interviews. Data was transcribed verbatim 
and member checked, before being coded and analysed with reference to the Model 
of Human Occupation.
RESULTS: Five themes emerged from the data; Consumer Growth [Volition], 
Facilitator's Occupational Identity [Volition], Role of Facilitators 
[Habituation], Workload of Facilitators [Performance Capacity], and Adaptation 
of The WORKS Resources [Performance Capacity].
CONCLUSIONS: All participants perceived benefits related to The WORKS however 
discussed a co-facilitation power imbalance between facilitators. Therefore, 
more development is needed around the co-facilitation relationship between 
Occupational Therapists and Peer-Support Workers.
