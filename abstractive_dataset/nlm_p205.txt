Neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with neurological soft signs (NSS), 
including motor, sensory, and inhibitory dysfunction. The present study aims at 
determining the prevalence of NSS and explore the association of 
sociodemographic characteristics with the occurrence of NSS in patients with 
bipolar disorder and unipolar depression compared to healthy controls. A 
case-control study included a sample of 50 bipolar and unipolar patients and 50 
healthy controls. NSS subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES) were 
administered to each participant. Significant differences were found in the 
total NES score, motor coordination, sensory integration, sequence of complex 
motor act and other subscales among the three groups. Compared with healthy 
controls, patients with bipolar disorder showed significantly more total NSS 
signs, motor coordination signs and sensory-integration signs. When compared 
with patients with unipolar disorder, patients with bipolar disorder showed 
significantly more sensory integration signs and a trend of difference in the 
sequencing of complex motor acts and other subscales. Our findings suggest that 
NSS may be specifically associated with bipolar disorder but not unipolar 
depression. The specificity of NSS expression has the potential to help the 
discrimination of bipolar disorder from disorders less likely to have a 
neurodevelopmental component such as major depression.
