CONTEXT: Developmental psychopathology theory suggests a relationship between 
early childhood adversity and mental disorder.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between the specific items on the Adverse 
Childhood Experiences (ACE) survey and the International Classification of 
Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) categories of psychiatric diagnoses in a 
pediatric sample.
DESIGN: The sample included patients enrolled in the Child and Adolescent 
Addiction Mental Health and Psychiatry Program with both a completed ACE survey 
and at least 1 diagnosis of record (per admission). These criteria yielded 2 
samples for each sex (ACE survey item frequencies and values in collapsed and 
multiple-admission groups). Data were analyzed employing tetrachoric 
correlation, hierarchical regression, and polychoric factor analysis.
RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analysis identified that ICD-10 diagnostic 
categories, except for substance disorders, were not consistently related to ACE 
total score and tended to reduce the magnitude of the ACE total score in the 
multiple-admission group. Tetrachoric correlation revealed very low (< 0.4) 
positive and negative correlations between ICD-10 categories and ACE items in 
both multiple-admission and collapsed sample groups. Polychoric factor analysis 
indicated that the ACE survey items and the ICD-10 categories for both sexes 
were independent, with only the diagnostic ICD-10 category substance disorders 
being marginally associated with the ACE items factor for females.
CONCLUSION: The nominal relationship between ACE items and ICD-10 diagnostic 
categories indicates the need to include ACE assessment in advance of 
differential diagnosis and implementation of conventional mental health 
interventions for children and adolescents.
