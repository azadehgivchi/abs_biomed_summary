STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study used ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) to 
investigate post-traumatic nightmares of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
The key research question was whether post-traumatic nightmares occur in both 
rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep, and if so, whether nightmares in 
each sleep stage differed in content, phenomenology, and heart rate response. 
Underlying sleep disorders were investigated in an exploratory way.
METHODS: Thirty-five treatment-seeking veterans, current serving military 
members, and emergency service personnel undertook full PSG using the 
Compumedics (Melbourne, Australia) SomtePSG V1 system, during an inpatient 
psychiatric admission. The PSG recording included an event button to be pressed 
when a nightmare occurred, allowing us to determine the stage of sleep, changes 
in heart rate, and associated sleep events. The content and phenomenological 
features of participants' nightmares were recorded.
RESULTS: Of the 35 participants, 29 reported a nightmare during their sleep 
study, but only 21 pressed the event button and could recall the content of one 
or more nightmare. This yielded sleep and nightmare data for 24 nightmares. Of 
the 24, 10 nightmares arose from REM sleep and 14 from non-REM (stages N1 and 
N2). Seven were accurate trauma replays and 17 were non-replay or a mixture of 
replay and non-replay. Most nightmares were associated with respiratory or leg 
movement events and increase in heart rate on awakening.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-traumatic nightmares of PTSD occur in both REM and non-REM 
sleep and are commonly associated with other sleep disturbances. These findings 
have important treatment implications.
