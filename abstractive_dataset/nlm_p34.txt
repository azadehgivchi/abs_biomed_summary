Objective: To introduce a set of revised guidelines for the management of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and persistent symptoms following concussive injuries.

Quality of evidence: The Guidelines for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Persistent Symptoms were made available in March 2011 based on literature and information up to 2008. A search for new clinical practice guidelines addressing mTBI and a systematic review of the literature evaluating treatment of persistent symptoms was conducted. Healthcare professionals representing a range of disciplines from Canada and abroad attended a consensus conference to revise the original guidelines in light of new evidence.

Main message: A modified Delphi process was used to create 96 recommendations addressing the diagnosis and management of mTBI and persistent symptoms, including post-traumatic headache, sleep disturbances, mental health disorders, cognitive difficulties, vestibular and vision dysfunction, fatigue and return to activity/work/school. Numerous resources, tools and treatment algorithms were also included to aid implementation of the recommendations.

Conclusion: The revised clinical practice guideline reflects the most current evidence and is recommended for use by clinicians who provide care to people who experience PPCS following mTBI.
