The initial diagnosis, molecular investigation, treatment, and posttreatment care of major psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia and bipolar depression) are all still significantly hindered by the current inability to define these disorders in an explicit molecular signaling manner. High-dimensionality data analytics, using large datastreams from transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomic investigations, will likely advance both the appreciation of the molecular nature of major psychiatric disorders and simultaneously enhance our ability to more efficiently diagnose and treat these debilitating conditions. High-dimensionality data analysis in psychiatric research has been heterogeneous in aims and methods and limited by insufficient sample sizes, poorly defined case definitions, methodological inhomogeneity, and confounding results. All of these issues combine to constrain the conclusions that can be extracted from them. Here, we discuss possibilities for overcoming methodological challenges through the implementation of transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomics signatures in psychiatric diagnosis and offer an outlook for future investigations. To fulfill the promise of intelligent high-dimensionality data-based differential diagnosis in mental disease diagnosis and treatment, future research will need large, well-defined cohorts in combination with state-of-the-art technologies.
