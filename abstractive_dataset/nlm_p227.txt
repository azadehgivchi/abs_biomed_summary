Research into the potential mental health consequences of abortion yields 
inconsistent results and is characterized by methodological limitations.<br /> 
AIM: To offer a more conclusive insight into women's mental health after an 
abortion by stringently taking both pre-abortion mental health and confounding 
covariates into account.<br /> METHOD: A prospective longitudinal cohort study, 
the Dutch Abortion and Mental Health Study (DAMHS), through which women with and 
without abortion experiences could be compared. The study was designed in a 
similar way to the large scale Dutch population study into mental health of the 
Trimbos Institute, the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 
(NEMESIS-2).<br /> RESULTS: Women who had an abortion were significantly more 
likely to have had previous DSM-IV mental disorders. Psychiatric history 
appeared to be associated with how women experienced and handled the unwanted 
pregnancy and abortion. A prior history of mental disorders, averse recent life 
events or an unstable partner relationship increased the risk of developing post 
abortion mental disorders, while experiencing an abortion did not.<br /> 
CONCLUSION: Women who have had an abortion more often have a history of mental 
disorders, yet there is no evidence that an abortion in itself would increase 
the risk of developing a mental disorder.
