BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Much research has documented that young men who have 
sex with men (YMSM) are at higher risk for substance use-related problems. This 
study examined the age of substance use initiation and it's relationship to 
current substance use-related problems among substance-using YMSM.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 191 YMSM (aged 18 to 29) with 
recent histories of prescription drug misuse was conducted in Philadelphia in 
2012-13. Participants were surveyed about age of initiation of cigarette 
smoking, alcohol use to the point of intoxication, marijuana, prescription, and 
illicit drugs, and about alternate modes of prescription drug administration. 
The severity of participants' current substance use related problems was 
measured using the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10).
RESULTS: Mean age of initiation was 14.6 years for cigarette smoking, 15.3 years 
for alcohol use to the point of intoxication, 15.2 years for marijuana, 
16.8 years for prescription drugs, and 17.9 years for illicit drugs. Use of 2 or 
more substances by the age of 15 was reported by 56% of the participants. Odds 
of substance-related problems were significantly greater among those who 
reported earlier initiation of alcohol, prescription drugs, or polysubstance 
use. Odds of prescription drug misuse via altered routes of administration were 
significantly greater among participants with earlier onset of alcohol, 
marijuana, prescription, illicit drugs, or polysubstance use.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that earlier initiation of 
substance use is associated with higher risk of substance-related problems among 
substance-using YMSM. Early interventions addressing substance use initiation 
could benefit this population.
