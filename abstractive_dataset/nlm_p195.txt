Pharmacogenetics is the study of how genetics influences drug treatment 
outcomes. Much research has been conducted to identify and characterize gene 
variants that impact the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic aspects of 
medications used to treat neurologic and psychiatric disorders. This chapter 
reviews the current state of pharmacogenetic aspects of these treatments. 
Medications with supporting pharmacogenetic information in product labeling, 
clinical guidelines, or important mechanistic implications are discussed. At 
this time, clinically relevant genetic variation in drug metabolizing enzymes 
may inform drug dosing for a number of medications metabolized in the liver. 
Additionally, genetic variation in immunological genes may be tested to assess 
risk for severe hypersensitivity reactions to some anticonvulsant drugs. 
Finally, a growing body of research highlights that genetic polymorphisms in 
drug targets may influence symptom response or tolerability to some treatments.
