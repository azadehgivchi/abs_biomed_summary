The present study analyzed the community functioning among Chinese people with 
common mental disorders and their relationships with different factors under the 
framework of Model of Human Occupation. The research team followed up a 
stratified random sample of 238 patients in three public psychiatric specialist 
outpatient clinics in Hong Kong in one year. The patients completed assessments 
at baseline and 12-month follow-up in four areas of community functioning (i.e., 
self-care, independent living skills, social skills, and work skills), 
self-esteem, self-efficacy, physical functioning, behavioral regulation, mental 
states, family expressed emotion, and perceived social stigma. The data showed 
that after 12 months, the patients had positive changes in self-care, work 
skills, and behavioral regulation. Those patients who had higher levels of 
self-esteem at baseline and reduced their negative reactions to stigma were more 
likely to improve social skills, while those patients who perceived less 
discrimination at baseline and enhanced their self-esteem would have a higher 
likelihood of making improvement in work skills. The findings implied that the 
rehabilitation services for people with common mental disorders might target on 
the enhancement of self-esteem and reduction of discrimination experience to 
facilitate their improvement in social skills and work skills.
