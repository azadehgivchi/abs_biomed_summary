OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether parental TBI increases the overall risk for 
psychiatric disorders and the risk for specific psychiatric diagnoses in the 
children affected by parental TBI.
METHODS: The 1987 Finnish Birth Cohort (n = 59 476) were followed up through 
national registers from birth to the end of 2008. The diagnoses of cohort 
members and their parents were obtained from the Care Register of Health Care, 
provided by the National Institute of Health and Welfare.
RESULTS: During the 21-year follow-up, the likelihood for psychiatric diagnoses 
being assessed in psychiatric care was significantly increased in males with any 
mental disorder (odds ratio (OR) = 1.43), substance-use-related disorders 
(OR = 1.71) and behavioural and emotional disorders (OR = 1.75), and in females 
with disorders of psychological development (OR = 1.85).
CONCLUSIONS: Children affected by parental TBI are at increased risk for 
psychiatric disorders: males for externalizing disorders and females for 
developmental disorders. Observed gender interactions in the association between 
parental TBI and the psychiatric disorders of children warrant further study.
