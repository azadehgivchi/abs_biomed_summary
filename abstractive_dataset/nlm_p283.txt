OBJECTIVE: Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) is closely related to and 
partially overlaps with social phobia (SP). There is an ongoing debate as to 
whether AvPD and SP can be classified as separate and distinct disorders or 
whether these diagnoses rather reflect different degrees of severity of social 
anxiety. The hypothesis of this study is that in patients with AvPD and in those 
with AvPD and comorbid SP both interpersonal functioning and metacognitive 
abilities (the ability to understand mental states) are more severely impaired 
than they are in patients with SP only. We also hypothesise that the 
interpersonal and metacognitive functioning of these patients (both AvPD and 
AvPD+SP) is comparable to that of patients with other PD diagnoses.
METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we compared four groups (22 patients with SP, 
32 patients with AvPD, 43 patients with both AvPD and SP and 50 patients with 
other personality disorders without SP and AvPD criteria) on metacognitive 
abilities, interpersonal functioning and global symptomatic distress.
RESULTS: Metacognitive ability showed significant variation among the four 
groups, with the lowest score observed in the AvPD group. As far as the 
interpersonal functioning is concerned, the lack of sociability was more severe 
in the AvPD group compared with the SP group. These differences were maintained 
even after controlling for global symptomatic distress.
CONCLUSION: Results are in line with the alternative model of PD, proposed in 
the DSM-5, as dysfunction of the self and relationships. They suggest that 
specific impairments in critical areas of self domains and interpersonal domains 
of personality functioning may serve as markers distinguishing AvPD from SP.
