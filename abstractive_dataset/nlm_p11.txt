In contrast to commonly used approaches to improve data quality in diffusion weighted imaging, position-orientation adaptive smoothing (POAS) provides an edge-preserving post-processing approach. This study aims to investigate its potential and effects on image quality, diffusion metrics, and fiber tractography of the corticospinal tract in relation to non-post-processed and averaged data. 22 healthy volunteers were included in this study. For each volunteer five clinically applicable diffusion weighted imaging data sets were acquired and post-processed by standard averaging and POAS. POAS post-processing led to significantly higher signal-to-noise-ratios (p < 0.001), lower fractional anisotropy across the whole brain (p < 0.05) and reduced intra-subject variability of diffusion weighted imaging signal intensity and fractional anisotropy (p < 0.001, p = 0.006). Fiber tractography of the corticospinal tract resulted in significantly (p = 0.027, p = 0.014) larger tract volumes while fiber density was the lowest. Similarity across tractography results was highest for POAS post-processed data (p < 0.001). POAS post-processing enhances image quality, decreases the intra-subject variability of signal intensity and fractional anisotropy, increases fiber tract volume of the corticospinal tract, and leads to higher reproducibility of tractography results. Thus, POAS post-processing supports a reliable and more accurate fiber tractography of the corticospinal tract, being mandatory for the clinical use.
