BACKGROUND: Psychiatric morbidity in children and adolescents is a major concern 
as they become more complex and intense with children's transition into 
adolescence.
AIM: The aim of this study is to assess and compare the prevalence of depression 
and anxiety among children residing in rural and suburban area of eastern Uttar 
Pradesh and understand the burden of these problems in our society.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children, in the age group 11-18 years, were divided into 
2 groups: Group I - 100 children from rural area Tikri; Group II - 100 children 
from suburban area Sunderpur. Their sociodemographic details were recorded. 
Children's Depression Inventory and Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale 
were used to screen for depression and anxiety in children, respectively. The 
final diagnosis was done using present state examination in accordance with 
International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders 10. Data were 
statistically analyzed using Chi-square test.
RESULTS: The prevalence of depression was found to be 14.5% while that of 
anxiety disorder was found to be 15%. There was no significant difference in the 
prevalence of depression or anxiety in rural and suburban areas (P > 0.05). 
Depression and anxiety were more prevalent in middle adolescence, in females, 
and in lower-middle socioeconomic group. Depression was more prevalent in the 
students of class 9th -12th, whereas anxiety was more in students of lower 
classes. Depression was more prevalent in joint families. These differences show 
some important trends regarding factors affecting these problems.
CONCLUSION: This study yields useful information which could be of use in early 
management of psychiatric disorders present in the community and prevent their 
development into chronic disorders.
