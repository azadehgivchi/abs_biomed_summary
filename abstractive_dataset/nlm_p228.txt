For the purpose of systematization of the directions of rendering psychiatric 
help to pensioners of law-enforcement bodies (OVD) of the Russian Federation 
with mental disorders, the analysis of the existing normative legal acts 
regulating psychiatric examination of employees of Department of internal 
Affairs of the Russian Federation at dismissal on retirement and attachment on 
medical care in departmental healthcare institutions is carried out. It is shown 
that the provision of specialized psychiatric and psychotherapeutic assistance 
to pensioners of internal Affairs of the Russian Federation is carried out 
mainly in the municipal health care system, there is no monitoring of the mental 
state of pensioners of internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, including 
combatants with post-stress disorders. Within the framework of the project Of 
the concept of development of the psychiatric service of the Ministry of 
internal Affairs of Russia, it is proposed to systematize approaches to the 
organization of psychiatric care for pensioners of the Ministry of internal 
Affairs of the Russian Federation with mental disorders in the structure of 
departmental health care, with the improvement of the regulatory legal framework 
for the organization of psychiatric care, which will ensure the provision of 
high-quality psychiatric care.
