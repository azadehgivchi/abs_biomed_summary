Psychiatric disorders are disturbances of cognitive and behavioral processes 
mediated by the brain. Emerging evidence suggests that accurate biomarkers for 
psychiatric disorders might benefit from incorporating information regarding 
multiple brain regions and their interactions with one another, rather than 
considering local perturbations in brain structure and function alone. Recent 
advances in the field of applied mathematics generally - and network science 
specifically - provide a language to capture the complexity of interacting brain 
regions, and the application of this language to fundamental questions in 
neuroscience forms the emerging field of network neuroscience. This chapter 
provides an overview of the use and utility of network neuroscience for building 
biomarkers in psychiatry. The chapter begins with an overview of the theoretical 
frameworks and tools that encompass network neuroscience before describing 
applications of network neuroscience to the study of schizophrenia and major 
depressive disorder. With reference to work on genetic, molecular, and 
environmental correlates of network neuroscience features, the promises and 
challenges of network neuroscience for providing tools that aid in the diagnosis 
and the evaluation of treatment response in psychiatric disorders are discussed.
