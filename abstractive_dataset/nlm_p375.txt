This case study presents a 37-year-old male who was experiencing excited 
delirium (ExD) and died in a county jail 4 days after being taken into custody. 
The male died in a jail observation cell without having been restrained and was 
not under the influence of a drug stimulant. The subject had a documented 
psychiatric history of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and was known to 
consume marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamines. This case illustrates the 
pernicious effects of ExD and how its lethality can be delayed when many cases 
involve drug use and use of force where subjects die shortly thereafter. 
Implications of ExD for correctional agencies and efforts of responding to it in 
correctional and law enforcement contexts are discussed.
