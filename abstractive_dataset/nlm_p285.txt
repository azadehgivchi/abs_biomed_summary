This study evaluates foster care history characteristics as risk factors for 
psychopathology. We examine characteristics of youths' foster care histories 
separately and as a gestalt (i.e., identification of latent classes). Six mental 
health disorders and lifetime suicide attempt were assessed via in-person 
interviews with a representative sample of older adolescents in California 
foster care (n = 706). Information on respondents' foster care histories were 
obtained from state administrative data. Half of the sample (47.3%) screened 
positive for a psychiatric disorder and 1/4 (25.2%) had attempted suicide. When 
assessed individually, placement instability predicted posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD), alcohol and substance use problems, and suicide attempt. 
Primary placement type and maltreatment type were also associated with 1 or more 
psychiatric disorders. When foster care characteristics were considered in 
concert, 6 latent classes were identified: veterans, returners, treated stayers, 
midrangers, late stayers, and disquieted drifters. Three latent classes 
(returners, late stayers, and disquieted drifters) were at increased risk of 
psychiatric problems relative to 1 or more of the other latent classes. Both 
separate foster care characteristics and the gestalt of youths' foster care 
histories identified risks of psychiatric problems. Results from these analyses 
can inform the development of risk assessment tools.
