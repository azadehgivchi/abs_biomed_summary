BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, which typically leads to 
severe impairments in cognitive functions including memory and learning. Key 
pathological features of this disease include the deposition of highly insoluble 
amyloid Î² peptides and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the 
brain. Mounting evidence also implicates sustained glial-mediated inflammation 
as a major contributor of the neurodegenerative processes and cognitive deficits 
observed in AD.
METHODS: This paper provides an overview of findings from both human and animal 
studies investigating the role of microglia and astrocytes in AD, and discusses 
potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.
RESULTS: Glial-mediated inflammation is a 'double-edged sword', performing both 
detrimental and beneficial functions in AD. Despite tremendous effort in 
elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying AD pathology, to 
date, there is no treatment that could prevent or cure this disease. Current 
treatments are only useful in slowing down the progression of AD and helping 
patients manage some of their behavioral and cognitive symptoms.
CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the role of microglia and astrocytes in 
the regulation of AD pathology is needed as this could pave the way for new 
therapeutic strategies.
