Years of research in the field of neurotrauma have led to the concept of applying systems biology as a tool for biomarker discovery in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Biomarkers may lead to understanding mechanisms of injury and recovery in TBI and can be potential targets for wound healing, recovery, and increased survival with enhanced quality of life. The literature available on neurotrauma studies from both animal and clinical studies has provided rich insight on the molecular pathways and complex networks of TBI, elucidating the proteomics of this disease for the discovery of biomarkers. With such a plethora of information available, the data from the studies require databases with tools to analyze and infer new patterns and associations. The role of different systems biology tools and their use in biomarker discovery in TBI are discussed in this chapter.
