ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a pattern of severe 
inattention-disorganization and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity beyond what is 
expected for individuals with a comparable development level. These behaviors 
impair daily life activities of patients in more than one environment and impact 
their performance and abilities compared with their peers. Extensive reviews 
have been published about the psychiatric comorbidities associated with ADHD but 
little attention has been given to the overall impact of ADHD on health. This 
study reviews some of the most common problems in medical care associated with 
ADHD like smoking, substance use, accident risk, sleep disorders, obesity, 
hypertension, diabetes, and early mortality. Today, a close follow-up of patient 
with ADHD is necessary not only from the psychiatric perspective but also in 
regard to general medicine issues to prevent the impact on health of those 
medical co-morbidities. Such conditions can end in severe chronic diseases with 
consequences and high cost for the individuals, the families and the society far 
beyond the academic and emotional impact frequently described as associated to 
ADHD. This condition has serious repercussions on health which need a medical 
multidisciplinary approach.
