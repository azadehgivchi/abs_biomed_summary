Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can develop 
following exposure to or witnessing of a (potentially) threatening event. A 
critical issue is to pinpoint the (neuro)biological mechanisms underlying the 
susceptibility to stress-related disorder such as PTSD, which develops in the 
minority of ~15% of individuals exposed to trauma. Over the last few years, a 
first wave of epigenetic studies has been performed in an attempt to identify 
the molecular underpinnings of the long-lasting behavioral and mental effects of 
trauma exposure. The potential roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as 
microRNAs (miRNAs) in moderating or mediating the impact of severe stress and 
trauma are increasingly gaining attention. To date, most studies focusing on the 
roles of miRNAs in PTSD have, however, been completed in animals, using 
cross-sectional study designs and focusing almost exclusively on subjects with 
susceptible phenotypes. Therefore, there is a strong need for new research 
comprising translational and cross-species approaches that use longitudinal 
designs for studying trajectories of change contrasting susceptible and 
resilient subjects. The present review offers a comprehensive overview of 
available studies of miRNAs in PTSD and discusses the current challenges, 
pitfalls, and future perspectives of this field.
