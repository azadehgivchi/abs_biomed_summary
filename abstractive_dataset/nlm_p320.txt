People with obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD] frequently suffer from 
depression, a comorbidity associated with greater symptom severity and suicide 
risk. We examined the associations between OCD and depression symptoms in 87 
adolescents with primary OCD. We computed an association network, a graphical 
LASSO, and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to model symptom interactions. Models 
showed OCD and depression as separate syndromes linked by bridge symptoms. 
Bridges between the two disorders emerged between obsessional problems in the 
OCD syndrome, and guilt, concentration problems, and sadness in the depression 
syndrome. A directed network indicated that OCD symptoms directionally precede 
depression symptoms. Concentration impairment emerged as a highly central node 
that may be distinctive to adolescents. We conclude that the network approach to 
mental disorders provides a new way to understand the etiology and maintenance 
of comorbid OCD-depression. Network analysis can improve research and treatment 
of mental disorder comorbidities by generating hypotheses concerning potential 
causal symptom structures and by identifying symptoms that may bridge disorders.
