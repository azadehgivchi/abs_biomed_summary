Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has moved from being an untreatable 
disorder to a disorder with multiple evidence-based psychotherapies. When a 
second generation of research showed that less intensive, easier-to-learn 
therapies could be nearly as effective, they offered an approach that would be 
responsive to the persisting unmet needs of these patients. This paper describes 
good psychiatric management (GPM), a once-weekly, generalist model that 
medicalizes the disorder, emphasizes psychoeducation, and focuses on social 
adaptation. It is proposed that this approach be the primary intervention for 
BPD; more intensive evidence-based psychotherapies thereby reserved for those 
who fail to respond. It is also suggested that whether GPM's focus on social 
adaptation yields significant effects that improve outcome in this domain 
deserves testing.
