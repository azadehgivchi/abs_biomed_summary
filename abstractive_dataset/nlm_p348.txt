BACKGROUND: A parental mental illness affects all family members and should 
warrant a need for support.
AIM: To investigate the extent to which psychiatric patients with underage 
children are the recipients of child-focused interventions and involved in 
interagency collaboration.
METHODS: Data were retrieved from a psychiatric services medical record database 
consisting of data regarding 29,972 individuals in southern Sweden and 
indicating the patients' main diagnoses, comorbidity, children below the age of 
18, and child-focused interventions.
RESULTS: Among the patients surveyed, 12.9% had registered underage children. 
One-fourth of the patients received child-focused interventions from adult 
psychiatry, and out of these 30.7% were involved in interagency collaboration as 
compared to 7.7% without child-focused interventions. Overall, collaboration 
with child and adolescent psychiatric services was low for all main diagnoses. 
If a patient received child-focused interventions from psychiatric services, the 
likelihood of being involved in interagency collaboration was five times greater 
as compared to patients receiving no child-focused intervention when controlled 
for gender, main diagnosis, and inpatient care.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric services play a significant role in identifying the 
need for and initiating child-focused interventions in families with a parental 
mental illness, and need to develop and support strategies to enhance 
interagency collaboration with other welfare services.
