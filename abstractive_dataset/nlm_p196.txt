Psychosis symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) are multifactorial in origin 
and, in later life, occur in the context of schizophrenia, delirium, dementia, 
delusional and schizophrenia-like disorders, mood disorders, and alcohol or 
substance abuse. The current article provides a clinical overview of very 
late-onset (after age 60) schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP), summarizing the 
literature on treatment options and reflecting on the role of psychiatric-mental 
health nurses (PMHNs). Increased awareness of the clinical presentation, key 
features, and evidence-based treatment options will assist PMHNs to confidently 
recognize this often under-diagnosed disorder and adopt a more assertive role in 
terms of engagement and follow up. Pragmatic research involving individuals with 
VLOSLP is required to increase the evidence base for treatment and improve 
outcomes of care. [Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services,
