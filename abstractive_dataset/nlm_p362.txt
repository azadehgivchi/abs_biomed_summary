Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major psychiatric disorder that is 
prevalent in combat veterans. Previous neuroimaging studies have found elevated 
amygdala activity in PTSD in response to threatening stimuli, but previous work 
has lacked the temporal specificity to study fast bottom-up fear responses 
involving the amygdala. Forty-four combat veterans, 28 with PTSD and 16 without, 
completed psychological testing and then a face-processing task during 
magnetoencephalography (MEG). The resulting MEG data were pre-processed, 
transformed into the time-frequency domain, and then imaged using a beamforming 
approach. We found that veterans with PTSD exhibited significantly stronger 
oscillatory activity from 50 to 450â€¯ms in the left amygdala compared to veterans 
without PTSD while processing threatening faces. This group difference was not 
present while viewing neutral faces. The current study shows that amygdala 
hyperactivity in response to threatening cues begins quickly in PTSD, which 
makes theoretical sense as an adaptive bottom-up fear response.
