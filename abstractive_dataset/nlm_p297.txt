Aggression Replacement Training (ART) is widely used to reduce aggression and is 
considered to be effective although there are also inconsistent results. Studies 
investigating the effectiveness of ART do not focus on neurocognitive 
characteristics. Focusing on these aspects would result in enhanced 
understanding of underlying mechanisms of ART. The current open uncontrolled 
treatment study assessed whether neurocognitive characteristics were associated 
with change in aggression during the social skills and anger control modules of 
ART among forensic psychiatric outpatients. Furthermore, differences between 
treatment dropouts and completers and change in these characteristics during ART 
were examined. A reduction of trait aggression, cognitive distortions, and 
social anxiety was observed. Neurocognitive characteristics were not associated 
with change in aggression, could not distinguish treatment completers from 
dropouts, and did not change after ART. It is suggested that new paradigms 
should be developed which take into account the social context in which these 
impairments appear.
