Anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) are 
the primary eating disorders (EDs). The only psychopharmacological treatment 
options for EDs with approval in some countries include fluoxetine for BN and 
lisdexamfetamine for BED. Given the high comorbidity and genetic correlations 
with other psychiatric disorders, it seems possible that novel medications for 
these conditions might also be effective in EDs. Areas covered: The current 
scientific literature has increased our understanding of how medication could be 
beneficial for patients with EDs on a molecular, functional and behavioral 
level. On the basis of theoretical considerations about neurotransmitters, 
hormones and neural circuits, possible drug targets for the treatment of EDs may 
include signal molecules and receptors of the self-regulatory system such as 
serotonin, norepinephrine and glutamate, the hedonic system including opioids, 
cannabinoids and dopamine and the hypothalamic homeostatic system including 
histamine, ghrelin, leptin, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1. Expert 
commentary: The latest research points to an involvement of both the immune and 
the metabolic systems in the pathophysiology of EDs and highlights the 
importance of the microbiome. Therefore, the next few years may unveil drug 
targets for EDs not just inside and outside of the brain, but possibly even 
outside of the human body.
