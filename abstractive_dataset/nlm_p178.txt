OBJECTIVE: Atypical Odontalgia (AO) is a condition characterized by tooth pain 
with no apparent cause. Although psychiatric comorbidity seems to be very 
common, it has rarely been studied. To clarify the influence of psychiatric 
comorbidity on the clinical features in patients with AO, we retrospectively 
evaluated their examination records.
METHODS: Clinical features and psychiatric diagnoses of 383 patients with AO 
were investigated by reviewing patients' medical records and referral letters. 
Psychiatric diagnoses were categorized according to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). We also analyzed 
visual analogue scale (VAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the 
short-form McGill pain questionnaire (SF-MPQ) scores.
RESULTS: Of the 383 patients with AO, 177 (46.2%) had comorbid psychiatric 
disorders. The most common were depressive disorders (15.4%) and anxiety 
disorders (10.1%). Serious psychotic disorders such as bipolar disorder (3.0%) 
and schizophrenia (1.8%) were rare. Dental trigger of AO was reported in 217 
(56.7%) patients. There were no significant correlations between psychiatric 
comorbidities and most of the demographic features. Higher VAS and SDS scores, 
higher frequency of sleep disturbance, and higher ratings of "Fearful" and 
"Punishing-cruel" descriptors of the SF-MPQ were found in patients with 
psychiatric comorbidity.
CONCLUSIONS: About half of AO patients had comorbid psychiatric disorders. 
Dental procedures are not necessarily causative factors of AO. In AO patients 
with comorbid psychiatric disorders, pain might have a larger emotional 
component than a sensory one. VAS, SDS, and SF-MPQ scores might aid in the 
noticing of underlying comorbid psychiatric disorders in AO patients.
