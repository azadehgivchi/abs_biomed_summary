OBJECTIVE: Dissociation is a complex, ubiquitous construct in psychopathology. 
Symptoms of dissociation are present in a variety of mental disorders and have 
been connected to higher burden of illness and poorer treatment response, and 
not only in disorders with high levels of dissociation. This meta-analysis 
offers a systematic and evidence-based study of the prevalence and distribution 
of dissociation, as assessed by the Dissociative Experiences Scale, within 
different categories of mental disorders, and it updates an earlier 
meta-analysis.
METHOD: More than 1,900 original publications were screened, and 216 were 
included in the meta-analysis, comprising 15,219 individuals in 19 diagnostic 
categories.
RESULTS: The largest mean dissociation scores were found in dissociative 
disorders (mean scores >35), followed by posttraumatic stress disorder, 
borderline personality disorder, and conversion disorder (mean scores >25). 
Somatic symptom disorder, substance-related and addictive disorders, feeding and 
eating disorders, schizophrenia, anxiety disorder, OCD, and most affective 
disorders also showed mean dissociation scores >15. Bipolar disorders yielded 
the lowest dissociation scores (mean score, 14.8).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings underline the importance of careful psychopathological 
assessment of dissociative symptoms in the entire range of mental disorders.
