A previous paper, in a series of three, presented the National Library of Medicine, Medline, PubMed and the MeSH system. Connection to PubMed via the Internet opens the PubMed search window that is the tool for retrieving references to scientific medical literature. This paper is intended as a tutorial for an inexperienced visitor to PubMed, and describes the search window in some detail. Several proposals for exercises in its use are given in the text, while explanations and comments to the exercises are presented in an appendix. The following procedures are described: retrieving references, ways to see the abstract, ways of displaying, sorting and showing the references, together with how to produce lists, import references to your own computer, and ways to get the full text of a paper.
