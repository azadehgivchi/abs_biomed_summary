AIM: Depression and anxiety are prevalent psychiatric conditions and are 
associated with overactive bladder. The objective of this study was to determine 
prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression associated with overactive 
bladder (OAB) in women.
METHODS: 274 women with clinical diagnosis of OAB were recruited from 2012 to 
2015. They were submitted to the International Consultation on Incontinence 
Questionnaire-Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB), the Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).
RESULTS: Severe or moderate depression was present in 59.8% of women and severe 
or moderate anxiety was identified in 62.4%. Higher scores of depression and 
anxiety were associated with higher scores of ICIQ-OAB (P = 0.0031 and 0.0049). 
Women with severe depression had higher nocturia score than those with mild 
depression (P = 0.0046). Also, women with severe depression had higher urgency 
incontinence score than those with minimal depression (P = 0.0261). Patients 
with severe anxiety had higher nocturia score than those with minimal anxiety 
(P = 0.0118) and women with moderate anxiety had higher urgency incontinence 
score than with minimal anxiety (P = 0.0300).
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate or severe depression and anxiety are prevalent in women 
with OAB. There is a correlation between intensity of OAB symptoms with 
depression and anxiety. Anxiety and depression levels are mainly related with 
urgency incontinence and nocturia.
