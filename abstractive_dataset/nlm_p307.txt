Through the major changes which the psychiatric hospital has undergone 
throughout history, the question is raised of the identity of caregivers, what 
the psychiatric asylum provides as a response to mental illness, and the 
function of the asylum as a place for receiving and then caring for patients, 
within society. These radical changes, which undermine the narcissism of 
caregivers, have consequences both within the psychiatric hospital and society 
as a whole. Consequences which question the very notion of care in a post-modern 
society.
