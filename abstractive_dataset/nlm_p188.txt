Anxiety separation disorder (SAD) became the subject of increased attention of 
researchers in recent decades. DSM-5 and project of ICD-11 allow us to treat 
this disorder as an independent nosological unit without attachment to age. The 
review provides information on the prevalence, clinical manifestations and 
diagnosis of SAD in adults, summarizes information on the etiopathogenesis, 
relations to other psychiatric disorders, and highlights the lack of modern 
therapeutic approaches to SAD. The purpose of this review is to raise the level 
of knowledge about SAD and its new positioning in classification systems.
