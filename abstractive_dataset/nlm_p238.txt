The putative role of gluten in the pathophysiology of severe mental illnesses 
remains uncertain and there is doubt about the possible benefit of gluten-free 
diets for individuals affected by psychosis and mood disorders. The objective of 
this review was to summarize the findings linking gluten related conditions to 
pathophysiological substrates implicated in schizophrenia and mood disorders and 
review the evidences of potential benefits of glute-free diets in these 
populations. A literature search was conducted within PubMed and Scielo 
databases including references from inception until March 1st 2017. The strategy 
search was to use the key words "gluten", "celiac disease", "wheat", "bipolar 
disorder", "mood disorders", "psychosis", "schizophrenia", "depression". In the 
review about the potential efficacy of gluten-free diets in severe mental 
illnesses, we included only studies with original data, including cross 
sectional and longitudinal studies and clinical trials. Book chapters, review 
articles and meta-analysis and republished data were excluded. Although the 
current available evidences suggest that people with celiac disease or gluten 
allergy could have a slightly higher risk of schizophrenia and mood disorders 
compared to the general population, the literature review reveals significant 
inaccuracies in the data. There is insufficient evidence to recommend 
gluten-free diets for populations with psychosis and mood disorders.
