This chapter will discuss the potential use of microRNAs, particularly those 
located in peripherally-isolated exosomes, as biomarkers in neuropsychiatric 
disorders. These extracellular vesicles are released as a form of cell-to-cell 
communication and may mediate the soma-to-germline transmission of 
brain-relevant information, thereby potentially contributing to the inter- or 
transgenerational transmission of behavioral traits. Recent novel methods allow 
for the enrichment of peripheral exosomes specifically released by neurons and 
astrocytes and may provide valuable brain-relevant biosignatures of disease.
