OBJECTIVE: to investigate the prevalence of Minor Psychiatric Disorders and 
associated factors in nursing workers.
METHOD: observational and analytical sectional study. Data were collected from 
285 nursing workers. A questionnaire containing sociodemographic, occupational, 
psychosocial aspects of work and mental health was used. Bivariate and 
multivariate analysis were performed by binary logistic regression.
RESULTS: the global prevalence of suspected Minor Psychiatric Disorders among 
nursing workers was 32.6%. Higher prevalence rates were found among female, 
young, married/common-law married individuals, in the nursing 
assistant/technician categories, with income up to four minimum wages, 
developing high-demand work with low social support, high effort-reward 
imbalance, and over-commitment.
CONCLUSION: the variables that remained associated with the mental health 
outcome in the final model were: female gender, married/common-law married, 
high-demand work, high effort-reward imbalance, and over-commitment.
