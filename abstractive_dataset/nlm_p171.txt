Adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often co-occurs with 
substance use disorders (SUD) and is associated with early onset and more severe 
development of SUD and with reduced treatment effectiveness. Screening tools 
allow for a good recognition of possible ADHD in adults with SUD and should be 
used routinely, followed by an ADHD diagnostic process initiated as soon as 
possible. Simultaneous and integrated treatment of ADHD and SUD, using a 
combination of pharmaco- and psychotherapy, is recommended. Long-acting 
methylphenidate, extended-release amphetamines, and atomoxetine with 
up-titration to higher dosages may be considered in patients unresponsive to 
standard doses. This paper includes evidence- and consensus-based 
recommendations developed to provide guidance in the screening, diagnosis and 
treatment of patients with ADHD-SUD comorbidity.
