Objective: To compare psychiatric in- and outpatient care during the 5 years before first delivery in primiparae delivered by caesarean section on maternal request with all other primiparae women who had given birth during the same time period.

Design: Prospective, population-based register study.

Setting: Sweden.

Sample: Women giving birth for the first time between 2002 and 2004 (n = 64 834).

Methods: Women giving birth by caesarean section on maternal request (n = 1009) were compared with all other women giving birth (n = 63 825). The exposure of interest was any psychiatric diagnosis according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ninth revision, ICD-9, 290-319; tenth revision, ICD-10, F00-F99) in The Swedish national patient register during the 5 years before first delivery.

Main outcome measures: Psychiatric diagnoses and delivery data.

Results: The burden of psychiatric illnesses was significantly higher in women giving birth by caesarean section on maternal request (10 versus 3.5%, P < 0.001). The most common diagnoses were 'Neurotic disorders, stress-related disorders and somatoform disorders' (5.9%, aOR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), and 'Mood disorders' (3.4%, aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.6). The adjusted odds ratio for caesarean section on maternal request was 2.5 (95% CI 2.0-3.2) for any psychiatric disorder. Women giving birth by caesarean section on maternal request were older, used tobacco more often, had a lower educational level, higher body mass index, were more often married, unemployed, and their parents were more often born outside of Scandinavia (P < 0.05).

Conclusions: Women giving birth by caesarean section on maternal request more often have a severe psychiatric disease burden. This finding points to the need for psychological support for these women as well as the need to screen and treat psychiatric illness in pregnant women.
