Inmates of Juvenile Developmental Centers are the special group of youth 
population who are in conflict with law and are vulnerable to psychiatric 
disorders. It was aimed to see the variation of prevalence and type of 
psychiatric disorders in institutionalized male juvenile offenders and 
non-offenders of same age, sex and socioeconomic group in the community. The 
association of mental disorders was examined in 138 male inmates of Juvenile 
Development Centers and 138 randomly selected comparison subjects in community. 
One stage-structured assessment of psychopathology was carried out by using a 
structured and valid Bangla version of the Development and Well-Being Assessment 
(DAWBA). Psychiatric diagnosis was established after scoring from DAWBA that is 
actually corresponds to diagnosis of ICD-10 for research. It was revealed that, 
of those who were in conflict with law, 57.2% had mental disorder, whereas 9.4% 
of non-offenders had psychiatric disorder. Among the offenders with psychiatric 
disorders, most of them (16.7%) suffered from Conduct Disorder (CD), followed by 
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). On the other hand, among the non-offenders with 
psychiatric disorder 2.2% suffered from CD. Study revealed that psychiatric 
disorders are more prevalent among the male juvenile offenders with comparison 
to non-offenders. Broad-based multi centered and cross cultural replication 
study can generalize the findings.
