Expressed emotion is a construct of the affective relationship between two 
people, with domains measuring criticism, hostility, warmth, relationship and 
emotional over-involvement. This review focuses on studies of Expressed Emotion 
in families of individuals with autism spectrum disorder and its association 
with co-occurring psychiatric disorders. A systematic search used the Psych-Info 
and Medline databases to identify articles available at or before September 
2016. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. The included studies suggest 
that high levels of expressed emotion, including criticism, are associated with 
behavioural problems. However, the relationship between expressed emotion and 
emotional problems is presently unclear because findings were mixed. Also, there 
is presently little evidence regarding the impact of other components of 
expressed emotion on co-occurring disorders.
