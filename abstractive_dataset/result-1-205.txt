Title:
Psychiatric disorders in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.
*****************************************
Extractive summary:
it is characterized by hyperandrogenism, abnormal periods (rare periods or amenorrhea) and polycystic ovaries visualized through ultrasonography.the most widely recognized hypothesis is that the development of pcos is due to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which subsequently lead to hyperandrogenism.bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders have also been reported in women with pcos more often than in the general population.
*****************************************
Abstractive summary:
the etiopathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome has not been elucidated in detail. the most widely recognized hypothesis is that the development of pcos is due to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which subsequently lead to hyperandrogenism. these symptoms can undoubtedly be stigmatizing for women and lower their quality of life.

Neurological consequences of traumatic brain injuries in sports.

Extractive summary:
traumatic brain injury (tbi) is common in boxing and other contact sports.the short term sequelae of acute brain injury including subdural haematoma and catastrophic brain injury may lead to death, whereas mild tbi, or concussion, causes functional disturbance and axonal injury rather than gross structural brain damage.following concussion, symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, reduced attention, amnesia and headache tend to develop acutely but usually resolve within a week or two.focal tau-positive nfts and neurites in close proximity to focal axonal injury and foci of microhaemorrhage and the predilection of cte-tau pathology for perivascular and subcortical regions suggest that acute tbi-related axonal injury, loss of microvascular integrity, breach of the blood brain barrier, resulting inflammatory cascade and microglia and astrocyte activation are likely to be the basis of the mechanistic link of tbi and cte.

we have reported that hypoxia affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis and behavior by driving the expression of central corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) and its receptors in adult mammals, and this effect is modulated by other factors.here, we address whether or not intermittent hypoxia (ih) or restraint (r) or a combination of both (ih+r) during gestation would result in differential alteration of the hpa axis and behavior of the adult male offspring.the crh-ne neural circuit between the pvn and lc through crh receptor driving might partly be involved in the effects.

Title:
The stress system in the human brain in depression and neurodegeneration.
*****************************************
Extractive summary:
corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) plays a central role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa)-axis, i.e., the final common pathway in the stress response.acth release results in the release of corticosteroids from the adrenal that, subsequently, through mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors, exert negative feedback on, among other things, the hippocampus, the pituitary and the hypothalamus.the most important glucocorticoid in humans is cortisol, present in higher levels in women than in men.at least five interacting hypothalamic peptidergic systems are involved in the symptoms of major depression.increased production of vasopressin in depression does not only occur in neurons that colocalize crh, but also in neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (son), which may lead to increased plasma levels of vasopressin, that have been related to an enhanced suicide risk.the hypothalamo-pituitary thyroid (hpt)-axis is inhibited in depression.on the other hand, there is also a lot of evidence for a direct involvement of glucocorticoids in the etiology and symptoms of depression.although there is a close association between cerebrospinal fluid (csf) levels of crh and alterations in the hpa-axis in depression, much of the crh in csf is likely to be derived from sources other than the pvn.organizing effects during fetal life as well as activating effects of sex hormones on the hpa-axis have been reported.such mechanisms may be a basis for the higher prevalence of mood disorders in women as compared to men.

Modulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis by Early Life Stress Exposure.
*****************************************
Extractive summary:
activation of the hpa-axis affects brain functioning to ensure a proper behavioral response to the stressor, but stress-induced (mal)adaptation of the hpa-axis' functional maturation may provide a mechanistic basis for the altered stress susceptibility later in life.the effects of els appear highly dependent on the developmental time window affected, the sex of the offspring, and the developmental stage at which effects are assessed.albeit by distinct mechanisms, els induced by prenatal stressors, maternal separation, or the limited nesting model inducing fragmented maternal care, typically results in hpa-axis hyper-reactivity in adulthood, as also found in major depression.this hyper-activity is related to increased corticotrophin-releasing hormone signaling and impaired glucocorticoid receptor-mediated negative feedback.

Brain corticosteroid receptor balance in health and disease.
*****************************************
Extractive summary:
in this review, we have described the function of mr and gr in hippocampal neurons.the balance in actions mediated by the two corticosteroid receptor types in these neurons appears critical for neuronal excitability, stress responsiveness, and behavioral adaptation.dysregulation of this mr/gr balance brings neurons in a vulnerable state with consequences for regulation of the stress response and enhanced vulnerability to disease in genetically predisposed individuals.the following specific inferences can be made on the basis of the currently available facts.1.colocalized hippocampal grs mediate a counteracting (i.e., disinhibitory) influence.through grs in ascending aminergic pathways, corticosterone potentiates the effect of stressors and arousal on hpa activation.6.dexamethasone preferentially targets the pituitary in the blockade of stress-induced hpa activation.

Differential stimulant response on attention in children with comorbid anxiety and oppositional defiant disorder.

Extractive summary:
approximately 30% of the children with adhd also have comorbid anxiety or oppositional defiant disorder.when compared with children with adhd alone, children with comorbid anxiety or oppositional defiant disorder may show worsening of the global attention score in response to methylphenidate and not only a "reduced response," as reported in previous studies.these findings were in contrast to children with adhd and comorbid anxiety or oppositional defiant disorder who showed a bimodal distribution and hence represent a distinct population.

although there is sufficient research and clinical evidence to support the inclusion of gaming disorder in the latest revision of the international classification of diseases, relatively little is known about the effectiveness of first-line psychological treatment for gaming disorder or internet gaming disorder (igd) as it is listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual.this systematic review employed meta-analytic techniques to determine the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (cbt) for igd on four key outcomes: igd symptoms, anxiety, depression, and time spent gaming.study reporting quality was evaluated in accordance with the consolidated standards of reporting trials guidelines.cbt demonstrated high efficacy in reducing igd symptoms (g = 0.92; [0.50, 1.34]) and depression (g = 0.80, [0.21, 1.38]), and showed moderate efficacy in reducing anxiety (g = 0.55, [0.17, 0.93]) at post-test.treatment gains at follow-up were nonsignificant across the four treatment outcomes.

Title:
Abiotic and biotic stress combinations.
*****************************************
Extractive summary:
the field environment is very different from the controlled conditions used in laboratory studies, and often involves the simultaneous exposure of plants to more than one abiotic and/or biotic stress condition, such as a combination of drought and heat, drought and cold, salinity and heat, or any of the major abiotic stresses combined with pathogen infection.recent studies have revealed that the response of plants to combinations of two or more stress conditions is unique and cannot be directly extrapolated from the response of plants to each of the different stresses applied individually.
